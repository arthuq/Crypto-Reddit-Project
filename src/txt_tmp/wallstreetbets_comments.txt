2023-02-01;No the question is IS there a buck to be made? Because so far the answer is no.  I‚Äôm a complete VR skeptic and see not no money maybe but very limited appeal. Arguments for it remind me a lot of the guys who 20 years ago swore up and down console gaming was doomed in like a Gen or two because PC gaming was so technically superior. Instead what happened is the exclusiveness of the PC market largely evaporated as multi-platform titles became the rule. Oh also everyone started playing with garbage on their phones.  The typical consumer has never cared about having the best experience.  Especially when said experience doesn‚Äôt slot so easily into a lifestyle that doesn‚Äôt involve extensive isolation in the basement. Hell even in the basement how am I supposed to find my piss bottle without taking myself out of the experience?

2023-02-01;I mean, Jpow is doing a decent job. The problem is that the market is getting way too ahead of itself and hears what it wants to hear.  Also, Jpow claims that he doesn't "want inflation to become entrenched in the minds of consumers and businesses" yet he's moving at a snail's pace.  I'd argue inflation has already become entrenched. I work at a multinational company and we sre still raising prices.

2023-02-01;As a data centre engineer I've had the unfortunate experience of dealing with Netflix at a professional level. They're clueless.   They incorrectly blocked one of our supernets so all clients within it couldn't use it. Every time I tried to talk to them they insisted there was no issue their end and it must be us. I pulled my hair out looking for anything that could be routing in some odd way that may look like a VPN.   Weeks went by until eventually I happened to speak to someone who actually understood the issue, whitelisted the subnets for the clients facing the issue and fixed the problem in 5 minutes.   I have absolutely zero faith they aren't going to completely fuck this up.

2023-02-01;Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.  That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

2023-02-01;The free market...    So as rates rise, interest wanes because the houses become less affordable, which in turn will cause the price to drop because there's no competition to drive the prices up.    If you see people bidding tens or hundreds of thousands over market, it means buyer interest (and therefore competition), exceeds market equilibrium by a massive amount.    As the rates drop again on the other side, if there is interest to create competition, then the price will rise because the limit of what the participants can get loans for goes up, and therefore the competition will increase.    If there isn't competition for the property, then the price will not rise, because there is nobody putting in higher bids to ever force the needle up.

2023-02-01;why do you idiots do this? You guys do the exact same thing to cramer. when some one says buy or sell they arnt timing the market by the day or hour. they are timing in general. probably with a time frame of 6+ months in mind.  geez it isnt that hard to figure out. these posts are so stupid.Just like when cramer said buy meta before earnings. if you did you would be up right now....

Essentially we go up in end of year target of fed funds rate of 5.25 to whatever if inflation rises. If inflation sustains we go up another 25 basis points. If we go down they might wait another FOMC and another CPI to determine raising earlier rather than later. Plan accordingly you filthy regards.

2023-02-01;This must be shares lol.  Options are flyyying.  Crazy lol.
2023-02-01;Of course. The lower the price of the home the cheaper the monthly payment will be. Ideally you want the price of the home to go down and rates go down lol.     If home prices crash with rates being high that's a win because you can always refinance when they start to cut rates. If home prices crash in the next year or two, even if rates are high that will likely be the once in a lifetime opportunity since you'll have the option to refinance all the way down in the years ahead.

2023-02-01;This is only the beginning. It's happening everywhere in the US on a micro scale like this guy. I predict cookie cutter vacation homes in underdesirable areas will start (if not already) hitting the market soon.  Those who purchased 2nd, 3rd...nth homes to do airbnb but are experiencing booking reductions even after lower prices. Eventually they won't be able to cover mortgage. Alot of these people also had amazing runs during the peak and likely didn't plan for a collapse so spent the money lavishly or acquired more property. Now they're stuck or Looking for Long term renters with leases that won't cover mortgage.  And then there are local governments cracking down on vacation homes. In atlanta for example an owner is limited to 2 airbnbs and owner must live in the state (bye bye institutional investor).  I go on... But I don't want to sound like chatgpt.

2023-02-01;It was priced in but the market always loves certainty. Also, I believe the market reacted to Jpows dovish talk afterwards
2023-02-01;Okay, sure, I agree that in that example from that clip, *for that like, 1 year indeed temporary period*, there was an artificially scarce supply. Which doesn't exist anymore as we type this moment.  Meanwhile, the reason in that example was, as he pointed out, because of community drafted and voted on rent control laws, not landlords' choice...
2023-02-01;YTD
2023-02-01;It means that the premiums on the options will be very low and you're basically gonna be at intrinsic value. Which, if meta opens at 180 for example, thats 15 bucks a share so contracts will be worth 15+a small premium so maybe 15.3-15.8 at open? Not really sure what the IV was but regardless you only have two days of theta. Still, depending on what you paid for them it should be a great win.
2023-02-01;bro, 2*420 is 840. Spy 840 eoy.
2023-02-01;He said sell the pump because tomorrow will dump
2023-02-01;&gt;	But you must be aware that there are places that will not have a surplus of inventory anytime soon,   Unless there is a drastic change sure but it happens. There are lots of towns and cities that were big and happening and are not anymore all in under 100 years. Which means we are going to likely see some implode in our lifetime.  Especially when we don‚Äôt have a birthrate that keeps or grows population.

2023-02-01;you realize none of that shit matters right now right. Like look, i play both sides and i was uber bearish for a long time. still think market is overvalued, but its far more likely we see a blowoff top to kill all the retail put players before we see any new lows. Especially with the market taking what the fed is saying as dovish (yes i know he was hawkish at points). Even the bond markets are pricing in a single rate hike going forward before a pivot. BUT if you look at history, you will see that more often than not the leg down happens after the pivot and not before. You know, so wall street can make sure you retain your line cook position at wendys and not pay your puts. but who knows, maybe you will get that big drop you want, but doubt it. Cathy will also be getting in your way because she was just proven right (at least for now) and will have no problem re-adding if it drops back down to the 140s.

2023-02-01;It‚Äôs a bull market where companies in bankruptcy can have shares rally 25% multiple days. Experience doesn‚Äôt count for much here. I have zero experience and i made 30% in gains. Am i better than you?  Being able to invest that much money puts you in a much easier place than most of us. To gain that much you just needed a 9% gain. I only have 1000 bucks invested. I‚Äôd need a 3400% gain to match you. Not only that, you bought shares. I‚Äôd need to rely on options that go up or down depending on which way JPow‚Äôs dick twitches. We are not the same.

2023-02-01;Up 100% on just stonks this year. Man I‚Äôm a great trader in a bull market
2023-02-01;Ok so inflation is coming down but not necessarily. Next FOMC in March they will discuss if they‚Äôre going higher in the rate. It‚Äôs currently at 4.75% and scheduling at least 2 more 25 bps to get to target because JPow said 2% inflation target is still heart of goal. Still sees a soft landing possibility but also fucking said transitory again. The main thing that worries me is transitory. I suspect we are at the absolute middle ground of sustaining a 5.25% end of year target or the Fed will increase its target like last year. Everything basically rides on the next 2 CPI reports but JPow said there is basically no way rates are going down in the next 4 quarters

2023-02-01;I remember for a couple of years before the 2008 crash there were a bunch of red flags. I was looking to buy my first home but deliberately waited because I didn‚Äôt trust the market. Ended up buying in 2010 just as the market was starting to pick back up again. Within 4 years my home was worth more than I could have afforded myself, now it‚Äôs worth a *lot* more.   This isn‚Äôt sustainable. The housing market is out of reach for most working people. There will be another great depression in the next couple of years IMHO.

2023-02-01;This is why I want nothing to do with real estate that is an appreciation play. Cash cows the way to go.
2023-02-01;Just so you are aware, a 700K home a year ago at 3.5% rate has a cheaper monthly payment than a 500K home at 5.5% rate. The 1% rate hikes add something like $500 a month to the monthly payment for homes around this range.      If rates go up to 7%, home prices may not fall THAT MUCH because people that bought their homes at rates below 4% aint selling because they won't want to buy the next home at a higher rate which in the long term will cost more. So the fed is looking to destroy jobs so people HAVE to sell their homes, adding more to the inventory. Inventory is increasing but not at a rate where home prices will drop 30% overnight.      Basically, we need home prices to drop another 30% for you to get the same value as you did 1 year ago when rates were at 3%. Whoever bought at 3-4% rates were like those that bought homes in 2009 when it comes to monthly payment affordability.

2023-02-01;You fool, the dogshit school system (48th in the country I believe) coupled with a Texas sized love of firearms will ensure we have elite regards who can‚Äôt go anywhere, leaving them ready to be mobilized to fight for the silver state when the water wars come.    All jokes aside, the HOA‚Äôs here are some of the worst I‚Äôve seen, unevenly enforcing rules and regulations and somehow never in the good neighbors favor. That, the way people drive like they‚Äôre on a suicide mission, and the general shit attitudes of residents pretty much are the worst aspects of Vegas for me. *However*, legal weed, top tier food, the weather, the easy access to so much of the Southwest US, the music scene, and the ability to get into whatever level of shenanigans you want whenever you want are all pretty solid pros. Not enough to say I want to make Vegas my home for life, but if house prices come back to reality again, I would definitely consider it. There‚Äôs worse places to live.
2023-02-01;Yeah a lot of people won‚Äôt sell but a ton of people will have to sell and that doesn‚Äôt also take into account home builders are going to keep building and the record amount of rentals are going to be built and putting pressure on the housing market.  Less sell, more inventory, more building, higher rates are a recipe for lower home prices. What‚Äôs great is if you like your home and you have steady employment and your stable in life you have nothing to worry about when your home losses value, unless you want to take money out of it and in that case might not be able to.

2023-02-01;I respect Cramer way more. At least when he's wrong, he actually goes on his show and admits he was wrong.   Everytime Burcuck is wrong, he deletes the tweet/his whole twitter account and never owns up to his wrong call outs. Just runs away, comes back when he thinks everyone forgot his previous bad callout, and says the same thing fear mongering cryptic tweets again. He also tries to block anyone calling him out.  Then eventually he's right and all his fanboys start saying told you so and such. As much shit as we give Cramer I can't remember a time he deleted his social media, blocked people sure, but not deleting tweets and social media.

2023-02-01;I use Robinhood so I look at ‚ÄúIV‚Äù on the option and you‚Äôll see a percentage number.  All stocks with earnings deal with decent to high iv, depending on if the stock acts crazy or volatile during earnings. I bought Meta calls 2/10 to avoid most of the iv. I‚Äôll still take a hit, but not as much as 2/3 calls. If you see a high IV number (for me it‚Äôs 90% and above) and the stock doesn‚Äôt move, kiss all that money goodbye.   Your gamble paid off a lot because you‚Äôll make so much money, that the iv crush won‚Äôt hurt as much if Meta went up only $10.   I just buy calls/puts dated the week after earnings right before earnings. Less profits if a home run happens (like meta today) but I can live with that.

2023-02-01;Uhhh you STILL don't get what they did wrong. They intentionally changed their formula to calculate the rating for the bundles in order to continue giving the newly create ones the identical high rating as the early ones. They didn't change the formula because they were less risky and then openly say this is a 2005 A+ bundle but if it was a 1995 bundle it would be given a C-. They just said Bundle 1 (circa 2005) has an A+ and so does Bundle 2 (circa 1995)! (The parenthesis are not obviously disclosed, if not actively obscured from the buyers. Their formula change is not disclosed to the buyer either.)

You can't just look at a single company when investing.  You need to look at their competition and what not.  AMD kept it real with their projections which aligns for a normal Q1.

2023-02-01;One problem with the way you guys are looking at it. If the 400k house appreciates 3% that's a 12k return on only the money you have invested into the purchase. So if you had to put 80k down that would equate to a 15% return on just the appreciation. Also, of course, you should have positive cash flow on top of that. I actually assume 0% appreciation when looking at rentals to make sure it's a good investment

2023-02-01;Dude, you don‚Äòt go short at the exact minute stocks crash. Details depend on strategy, but timing the exact day the markets will crash is fiction. The trade works or does not work out. That‚Äòs what matters. We don‚Äòt know what trade he has made, but I seriously doubt it was a 0dte put (unless he spent too much time in this sub).

2023-02-01;&gt;	Plenty of places are immune  No place is immune from housing crash. Just less likely and ONLY if there is still a demand to live there. Detroit back the day would have been considered immune because of the big auto manufacturing going on there but that got automated and moved and now you can get a house for the price of a dvd player.
2023-02-01;hey now anyone can enjoy a good anal
2023-02-01;I dunno, the guy who came up with that was a genius.
2023-02-01;Theres an old saying for traders, you've probably all heard it but its good to have a reminder.  The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.  This pump is bullshit and waaaaay overblown, anyone with half a brain knows that. Theres some fuckery afoot. But it doesn't matter, because big boys are in control of trillions of dollars and have 100s of billions of cash to invest. They will be the first ones out the door when the momentum shifts leaving retail to hold the bag again, so in reality its a pretty low risk thing for them to pump. They have the algos and will get out on time and the financial sophistication to hedge.  I think we are going 420-430 range, I havent seen this much bullishness in a long ass time, but I think thats a historic shorting opportunity as well so its not all bad. Hopefully you didn't get trapped in losing positions my fellow bears, but our day(s) will come again soon.
2023-02-01;Beginning of the week, I was thinking puts on everything. Now I'm thinking calls on Apple, Google, and Amazon. So definitely buy puts.

2023-02-01;Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.  That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies.

2023-02-01;.25% increase in interest rates, sounds like more increases in the future.  Powell is quoted as saying:   "inflation has eased somewhat but remains elevated." The Fed no  longer noted Russia's war in Ukraine as contributing upward pressure on  inflation, but said this conflict is contributing to elevated global  uncertainty.  Speaking in a press conference on Wednesday, Fed  Chair Jerome Powell was somewhat more optimistic on the outlook for  inflation, saying: "We can now say for the first time that the  disinflationary process has started."

2023-02-01;That's Socal too.  Worse is the new ones in Centennial are PUDs, which arent even mcmansions, but free-standing apartments that are 4 feet from one another and go for $500k.  You see those in new neighborhoods in CA too, some are attached and dont have garages or driveways or even back yards, and want $990k for the privilege of hearing your neighbors snore and have assigned street parking, $500/mo mello roos and a $600/mo HOA, oh and you are forced to use one internet provider, no exceptions, which was provided by the developer. You have to get your TV services through the internet provider too. So no satellite TV, no cable TV, and you can't use the cable provider or frontier for internet.  I know someone who bought into one of these neighborhoods in CA and moved because it was worse than living in an apartment complex. They sold when the value went up to 900k (they bought at 660k) so they walked away smelling like roses and bought a free standing home with no HOA elsewhere.

2023-02-01;You should evaluate the cash on cash return. Ideally you take a loan so your investment is leveraged. The value is appreciating at the nominal value and not the 20-30% you put down.

2023-02-01;At this pace inflation will be 2.5-3% by July and fed funds rate at 5% will legitimately seem high.

2023-02-01;I knew a guy who rented a garage with cash, put up a fake business there doing auto repair for imports. Put ads everywhere, then he stockpiled about 30 cars that were 'waiting on parts', took a 50% deposit in the 'parts' from all of his customers , stripped all of their cars one night of any valuable parts and simply fled town. No one knew what his name was so they couldn't find him. Was crazy seeing all of the tow trucks taking away the stripped vehicles. I figure the guy probably made away with 30-40k profit.

2023-02-01;In SoCal, we're dealing with the problem of homes being so expensive that when rates go up, nobody can afford to move.  The house values might be crashing, in terms of what a real buyer can afford to purchase, but the inventory is still extremely small, because the only way to survive selling your house is to move somewhere else where the equity on what you have is enough to buy outright, or close enough to keep your payment affordable.  Not many people want to buy a house with an extra bedroom when it might triple their mortgage payment. Unfortunately, this phenomenon has made demand seem high just by keeping supply unnaturally low.

2023-02-01;Michael Burry appears to have serious doubts about the stock market's stunning start to the year. He tweeted a single word on Tuesday: "Sell."  The fund manager of "The Big Short" fame was likely urging investors not to be fooled by the recent rebound in stocks. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index gained 6.2% in January, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite surged 11%, marking its best January performance since 2001.  Some of the hardest-hit stocks last year have led the charge upward. Elon Musk's Tesla notched a 41% gain in January, making it the second-best performer in the S&amp;P 500, while Cathie Wood's flagship Ark Innovation fund recorded its best month ever. Burry's Scion Asset Management fund placed bets against both the automaker and the tech-focused fund in 2021, and the investor took aim at both Musk and Wood in tweets.  Investors dumped tech stocks years after a historic spike in inflation spurred the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates from nearly zero to north of 4%, in a bid to curb the pace of price increases. They have piled back into them this year, as they believe inflation is waning and the Fed will soon pivot to cutting rates, which could revitalize demand and allow the US economy to escape a recession.
2023-02-01;Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.  That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

2023-02-01;I have a feeling this guy was an amateur and overpaid on the contractor. Like the only contractor who would show up was the most expensive. This happens a lot to my Brother-in-law. He just had to buy a house out in the middle of nowhere that you drive down a half mile dirt road then up his snaked driveway that does not feel safe at all especially bringing in a big truck. So he'll tell us about how his bathroom renovation costed so much and the guy didn't finish it because they didn't like how it was turning out but he was the only one who would drive out there. Then they basically paid double to have another guy come out and redo the whole thing.

2023-02-01;The Fed's job isn't to keep groceries cheap, it's to keep inflation around 2%. They're not going to raise rates so high that we get *deflation* and your grocery bill goes *down*. They're just trying to slow the rate at which your grocery bill goes up.  (Inflation was low the past few years before this so in theory we should have all been high on the hog with unchanging grocery prices and a bull market year after year. But of course you never remember the good times as much as the bad!)

2023-02-01; in [Greek mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology) was a Trojan priestess dedicated to the god [Apollo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo) and fated by him to utter true [prophecies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophecy) but never to be believed. In modern usage her name is employed as a rhetorical device to indicate a person whose accurate prophecies, generally of impending disaster, are not believed.

2023-02-01;There are a lot of people in this situation and a whole lot more coming soon. Everyone is driving a new SUV with a $600 payment plus expensive insurance and higher-than-ever gas prices just to work from home and drive to the grocery store less than 3 miles away. Everyone wanted those Pinterest floors and put it all on credit cards. Many were blindsided by a sudden increase in their homeowner's insurance and property taxes. As soon as anyone is hit with a divorce, job loss, new baby, major car repair, etc; no one can afford those home payments. I have a neighbor and a friend in similar situations; they bought near the peak in 2021 and are currently talking about selling (but there's no way they can get what they paid for).
2023-02-01;Lumber and shipping prices have decreased. Probably masks, TP, hand sanitizer, etc. oil and gas, and electricity prices fluctuate as we know as well.

2023-02-01;Yes, for over a decade there has been blatant mismanagement and irresponsible fiscal policies, and yes, poor people got used to working harder for less and corporations got used to socialism for the rich and free bail outs by Uncle Sam and record profits every year despite running a shittier and shittier business.   Comparing anything to the 1980‚Äôs is disingenuous because wages were much, MUCH higher and the cost of goods and services was much, MUCH lower. And the people who were making the decisions were held accountable in the 1980‚Äôs. Today we have a caste system and no accountability for the rich  It‚Äôs not high, it‚Äôs downright theft. In the 80‚Äôs one working parent could support an entire household and have ownership.. Whereas today, if you are a millennial and want to buy a house on a tradesmen or nurse‚Äôs salary, you are completely priced out of the market and have to marry to maybe qualify for a complete shit hole.   The fiscal policy over the last 20 years can only be described as treason. I feel bad for anyone who was born after 1990 and has effectively had any opportunity of ownership stolen from them. An entire generation of people will never own anything and you‚Äôre defending it.. this country is fucked beyond repair

I am wary of those because god knows what is going on behind the walls. You know damn well the electrical is shoddy and the plumbing is probably half-assed.
2023-02-01;Because fools keep plowing ahead and buying a 750 sq/ft shitbox full of asbestos and lead on 1/8 acre for $500K. Same reason cars now cost $50-100K, idiots keep buying them for those absurd prices despite the fact they can barely afford the payments.

2023-02-01;I completely agree. Facebook is a dying platform that is only used by old people. Young people don't care about it at all and this is where the money is. They think virtual reality is for gay nerds and real men don't play computer games. This metaverse bullshit is complete nonsense and my puts are fucked because of it.

2023-02-01;If you're happy with your 30% gains, then more power to you. But if you're missing out on 400% gains because you refuse to chase them, then you're not doing yourself any favors.

2023-02-01;It‚Äôs been around since before Tiktok. It got really popular in the last decade where lots of people bought houses, dumped $50k into them, then sold it for $100k more than the original investment and declared themselves home flippers while ignoring the $50k ROI was entirely from appreciation and not their renovations.   Millennial investors are about to experience their first decline in the housing market and a lot are gonna get wrecked.

2023-02-01;just take a step back and evaluate your strategy. You will hit bad streaks trading options, the key is recognizing it and not go on tilt.
2023-02-01;I have said before if you are going to do something, do it for spite, but I never thought about applying that to puts
2023-02-01;I cut gains at 30% now missed out on multiple 400% today and just refuse to chase it back because once I do I get burned

2023-02-01;Thanks for the idea, i yolod in 500$ and am up 7k :)
2023-02-01;The fed raising rates isn't going to lower prices, it's too late for that. It is to get inflation to a reasonable level (1~3%), aka raising prices. That means the trip to the grocery store today is going to be $102 next year if things work out.
2023-02-01;Before it, actually.
2023-02-01;Feels like we've been in that phase for a while already.
2023-02-01;it's not a sellers market anymore.    we are looking at a property that the lady wants to get 850k for.  Thing is they've only had it a year and a half and bought it for 571k.  They've also not talked to a realtor yet, at least not their own, ours talked to them.   No way they're going to get the 850k they want, at least not from us.
2023-02-01;idiot. you should have been smart and done a pizza ladder like me
2023-02-01;Neither

2023-02-01;Powell hasn't been interested in tanking things ever. If he was then he would have pushed harder rate increases and we would have landed already. He's dragging this out as much as possible because he wants to make himself look better and/or hand the whole mess over to the next guy lol
2023-02-01;Where were you when Big Pizza took over
2023-02-01;we‚Äôre not
2023-02-01;LOL. Where was the pivot? He confirmed two more 25bps hikes to 5 - 5.25%. Said rates were not yet restrictive enough. Means he's still overshooting and we won't see to full impact til probably next year.
2023-02-01;Many routers come with vpn servers on them, but most people would sooner drop netflix than go through the hassle.
2023-02-01;&gt;I gave no indication of being stupid enough to think they meant volcanoes.  Debatable.  Jokes aside, my largest point is that "living wherever you want" and the implicit building of a personal shelter in pre-agricultural society ("Stone Age" in your original terms), isn't even an idea that needs to be challenged on its face or engaged with on those terms.  People didn't build personal shelters in a way that'srelevant to the way we think of housing or our modern real estate market.    I'm agreeing with your end conclusions by dismissing this guy's point entirely at the premise.

2023-02-01;I made an extremely risky investment because everyone on the internet talked about how BRRR is printing money. Now I owe $100,000 more dollars than it's worth (closing costs and realtors 6% isn't mentioned) since I bought property when property was in it's largest bubble in history.   Sounds like the people complaining they bought their Tesla in the biggest used car shortage/EV demand, now they slashed the price by $7500 since the bubble finally popped and they feel like Tesla's the problem.   All these actions are no different from buying company stock when everyone is talking about it and when it is in great demand, then when it is no longer in demand and the price is half of what you bought it for you're stuck with your investment.

2023-02-01;That gets messy when you have to account for housing developments. One of the key causes of high prices is lack of demand, and making it less profitable to build new properties isn‚Äôt a good thing. Not everyone wants to own if they‚Äôre young or plan to move.  Taxes like this should be limited to old stock condos and homes, not new construction apartments.

2023-02-01;Everyone focusing on the bs Powell said, the most important piece by far is the fact he completely ignored that financial conditions have eased to before rate hikes started. This is what caused the rally, he essentially declared victory on inflation, aka the exact same thing he was warning about last year. How many times did he say last year that you can't declare victory too early? And he went off and did exactly that today  Calls until the next leg up in inflation, puts on the middle class, Powell completely fukked up today.

One of you might sell it for 1M so someone.  Again one of your neighbours might close at 100k, for different reasons. Every real esteadt deal should be treated as personal single one.

2023-02-01;I think the stock market will be the Tofu Dreg housing of the West, becoming the only meaningful way to invest money for most people. I expect it to go parabolic for a decade at least as people enjoy making money and regulators are just ex-industry players that enable as much wealth to be squeezed as possible.  At this point, there is essentially no way for new competitors to enter classic markets, as the 5 brands that own everything can subsidize losses into dozens of other markets to out compete in two or three markets, and easily tap cheap labor to undercut on costs.

I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.  That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies.

2023-02-01;Probably multiple things dumb if he is in this situation.
2023-02-01;If the ask price of a stock rises sharply but the bid price remains unchanged, it could be an indication that there are very few buyers willing to pay the higher asking price. This could lead to a lower volume of trading activity and may make it more difficult for investors to buy or sell shares at their desired prices.

2023-02-01;&gt;  So obviously this person isn't claiming you could live inside a volcano  ? I gave no indication of being stupid enough to think they meant volcanoes.  Of *course* they meant "actually nice, desirable locations like under the oak tree" but *No you couldn't just choose any of those you wanted*. That's precisely the sort of example I'm rejecting.  In feudalism (he said "any time before capitalism"), that oak tree is owned by a lord, you absolutely need to be their tenant and get permission and pay taxes to them to live there.  In tribalism, you aren't paying taxes, but I find it absurd to think that you wouldn't have needed a general approval and consensus from the tribe to go build a new roundhouse somewhere.  &gt; Just walk off into the woods away from any other humans and live wherever you want to.  This example is roughly as silly as the volcano example, though, and also surely not what he meant. Going off on your own away from any society = suicide, pretty much as reliably as jumping into a volcano would be suicide.

2023-02-01;I mean that whole irrational longer than solvent bullshit, but honestly I havnt seen a bit of good news.  I have a feeling at this point forward thinking is out the window until CPI turns hotter as the dollar deflates faster than the rates bring down demand....and the fed loses total control and we cascade into a deep recession at some fucking magic dart point in the future.  I do know after the last 1.5 years, market confidence is in the shitter, so the rugpull will be a cascade this next time.  Good luck timing it though.

2023-02-01;You can't pump 40 billion into your cap without drawing the attention of big shorts.  I wouldn't ve surprised in Bill Gates shorts this thing back to 150.
2023-02-01;I hate how people act like gentrification is only bad. Do they want the shitty, rundown, crime ridden, drug infested neighborhoods to continue to deteriorate and bring more of that into the area, or do they want the neighborhood 5 blocks over to be a decent spot so their car isn‚Äôt broken into at night?   It sucks when it‚Äôs a lower middle class area that‚Äôs in a town and working people get priced out, it can definitely have negatives. When it‚Äôs a straight up ghetto though, renovate that shit

2023-02-01;Opportunity loss isn't the same thing as a literal loss.  So yes, there is such a  thing as risk-free returns.  If a legit bank offers you 5% on a CD, you WILL get the 5%.
2023-02-01;Fair enough. I just don‚Äôt see the bullish stance because of the horrible guidance for 2023.   I mean why not give a full year guidance but still saying that Q1 will be our most difficult quarter?  It sounds contradictory to me and if Sue was really confident why not offer buybacks?

2023-02-01;Depends on where you‚Äôre coming from that matters, for over a decade we had lower rates and that created a whole new environment that people and systems and things got used to.  Comparing todays higher rates with rates of the past I.E the 80‚Äôs is disingenuous because prices and wages aren‚Äôt the same, nor is a lot of things.  By todays standards they‚Äôre high because of assets allowed to inflate for over a decade.  Yes a 15% rate was high in the 80‚Äô but you could buy a fucking nice house for $60-$80k lol

If you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!  A few tips though!  * Don't just submit a chart of the current price. Come on. Google only costs $5 per search. (wait, you guys are searching for free?)  * Reaction gifs are *fucking lame*. Put that shit in a comment, no one wants to look at your face in real life anyways so why are you making a thread about it.  * Don't repost stuff. All of us are terminally online, how dare you try and make us laugh with an image posted somewhere else. Jokes aside, we don't want to beat a joke to death, so give us some fresh OC and we'll be a lot cheerier.

2023-02-01;I was going through my portfolio looking for stocks to sell, and I feel like the crash already happened.   Most of my stocks are down anyway.  I‚Äôve lost thousands on Carnival Cruise and Spotify.  I‚Äôm only up on Exxon and Chevron‚Ä¶and I know Chevron is doing stock buy backs in April, so why would I sell now?   My mutual funds are making a slow recovery.  But since the beginning of 2022, I‚Äôm down 20,000 on all my stocks, collectively.   Maybe Cassandra is telling people to sell so he can swoop in and buy things cheaply.  Like he‚Äôs trying to use his influence to game the market.   I also don‚Äôt like the fact that he‚Äôs invested so heavily in for-profit prisons.  Don‚Äôt buy stock in things that are detrimental to society.

2023-02-01;I completely agree. Performance is important, but shareholders are the ones who ultimately matter most to a company. If they're happy, then the company is doing well. Saving money to buy back shares is a great way to keep them happy and ensure that the company continues to do well.

2023-02-01;I work in a tech company that ranks mid 200s in Fortune.  In past quarters they have cut bonuses when we had bad performance as a company.   Today they announced a furlough in March. Mandatory shut down. No work, no pay, for salaries employees.  I haven't seen that since I was in school in 08 when the teachers had reduced hours to avoid layoffs. Students still had to pay full tuition...  Anyway I think it's happening but slower than we thought (soft landing?) I'm not sure you can make money off this as much as minimize the damage to what you have.

Neither of which I am willing to do.   There‚Äôs good money in it if you‚Äôre scaled up enough to separate yourself from the day-to-day BS. But it‚Äôs a huge pain in the ass until then.

Interest rates up, stock market down, until this last year!!!
2023-02-01;Well, it would be an IPO, just saying....
2023-02-01;Great point. Also worth noting in this actual scenario is that the market has apparently already fallen more than 30%, given that he can't get an offer above 200 on a 305 appraisal. Or, more likely, his appraisal is just bad, and he forecasted incorrectly.  And even if it appraised at 350, as you accurately point out, it would need to for the above scenario to be correct. Well, the existing note is already 70% of the appraisal value. So he couldn't cash out anything without increasing the risk beyond what BRRRR advocates.

2023-02-01;Look, jpow wasnt really saying anything that could lead to an early pivot or cutting rates. Market just wanted to fuck puts today. Nothing changed. Economy weak, Inflation high not really coming down quickly enough to make the FED pivot and recession barely even started. I know Momentum fully in favor of bulls but it won‚Äôt last just like the Summer rally did not Last and rightly so.
2023-02-01;The one time I inversed Cramer, mf is turning out to be right. Lend me a rope somebody
2023-02-01;&gt; It was a short vertical spread so understand that my MAX PROFIT on this trade should have been 6k   Isn't this a bear call spread?  From your screenshot it looks like gamma exploded on the 4120 call and it was super underpriced relative to 4110 call. Everyone was pouring in trying to buy the cheaper high value call. When you went to close, you put through two orders and went long with a bull call spread. Gamma wore off on the 4120 as price stabilized and more volume went into the 4110 calls.

2023-02-01;Alright alright I can speak to this as I live in Memphis. I have seen this house online. Totally trying to gentrify the neighborhood. Poster is an idiot, as even replacing the windows on that house in the neighborhood it‚Äôs in is an over investment. Take the L my dude.

2023-02-01;Just got a gallon the other day for $1.99‚Ä¶beef prices where I‚Äôm at are going downs  We‚Äôre in a disinflationary environment in a lot of places and rightfully so, things will ebb and flow and eventually prices will go back up when they start to lower rates and increase the money supply again.     Homes are not an investment they‚Äôre a liability‚Ä¶that kind of thinking is dangerous and part of the reason for the last crash.

2023-02-01;Ugh, why ?
2023-02-01;I guess it‚Äôs kinda expected with selling naked calls that inevitably there‚Äôs a mini blow up moment but hopefully still net profitable. Did this move set u back like a month of profit or more?

2023-02-01;RemindMe! One year
2023-02-01;Grew up there and left for Nashville. After 5 years in Nashville I‚Äôm fully considering moving back.   It‚Äôs nowhere near as bad as everyone acts. It‚Äôs so fucking cheap. This house is still $500k in Nashville. Which is total bullshit. We‚Äôre talking a 3 hour drive between the two.   And here‚Äôs the best part, you get paid basically the same in both cities for white collar work. Why the fuck would I buy a $500k cardboard box when all the luxuries of Nashville are only a 3 hour drive away?   Am I saying live directly *IN* Memphis? No. I don‚Äôt wanna defend my home on the daily. But you can live within easy commuting distance for only slightly higher prices. It‚Äôs so cheap it almost feels criminal. I‚Äôm talking retiring at 40 cheap instead of probably never retiring if I try to keep up with the Jones‚Äô here in Nashville. No state income tax and everyone can fuck off with the sales tax/property tax argument‚Ä¶. Guess what, we still come out ahead down here. I‚Äôm a fucking accountant, you think I haven‚Äôt done the math?  You still have an international airport in both Memphis and Nashville. My Ole Miss Rebels are an hour away. The Grizzlies are there. 3 hours from Titans and Preds, both easily accessible on weekends. 7 hours from the beach.    Is it a desirable fad destination to live and work? No. Is it Siberia? Hell no. Beats the shit out of living in Oklahoma or Wyoming or Kansas or Nebraska or Idaho or basically 90% of the central US.

2023-02-01;Because they're a dipshit. I wouldn't be surprised if this person lived out of town/state, got a(n inexperienced) property manager to oversee the renos and house, and only came to find out how fucked everything was when it was too late to do anything about it.   Saw a house in 2020 where a similar scenario happened with the seller, who lived in CA but was trying to sell a house he flipped in a shitty neighborhood in Nashville that had over $125k worth of ESSENTIAL work (work that would ensure the house didn't just collapse fall into the ground one day) noted within multiple inspection reports that his local property manager was supposed to keep him informed of and didn't. This dude had paid at least $300k into a house that he was trying to sell for double the price, but still has $125k+ of work to put into it before anyone would consider buying it.

I'll be forever tied to Netflix because my wife is technologically challenged and there's a "Netflix" button on both the remote for our bedroom TV and the Nvidia Shield Pro.  I have a media server with however many tens of thousands of hours of other content and tell her all the time I can get whatever she wants, but it can't compete with the Netflix button on those remotes.  There are more of her than there are salty people on the internet who are losing free, convenient content.

2023-02-01;Exactly. "Highest rates since 2007 u guise!" Yeah it's also the lowest hike in 10 months, this is bullish.
2023-02-01;Yeah, definently, good for you man! üòÄ  The crypto also ripped in response to Jpow and at close my COIN position was up 96,98%.  This will probably be the first 2x i got from my long term stock portfolio since 2021, which is nice.   I'm thinking Coinbase will report a nice quarter because of the fact that trading valumes have been a lot higher that usual over the past two months.  At close, my pos in FB was up 57,73%, and since the stock rose almost 18% today it's looking pretty good.   In total, long term portfolio gained 2,17% today  so yeah  it was good day!

2023-02-01;Real question:  I‚Äôm new-ish to this shit so bear with me  The 2/3 put to call ratio on META is insane. I understand it‚Äôs because most people are bearish on META which honestly makes a little sense. But the puts are so off the charts you need it to drop like 12-16% to even breakeven from the premium. Is it still worth jumping on? Or has the gravy train left the station and should I just wait and keep observing before putting my head on the chopping block?

2023-02-01;&gt;The market looks good today. Stocks are up across the board and there is positive news on several fronts. The Fed raised interest rates again, but this was widely expected and does not seem to be having a negative impact on stocks. In fact, many companies are reporting strong earnings today and their stock prices are rising in response. There is also some good news on the job front, with ADP reporting that private sector job growth cooled slightly in January but remains at a healthy level overall.
2023-02-01;Lmao you can‚Äôt accept that you have it easier than most people in the world with almost a million dollar in assets?

2023-02-01;Flippers generally aren't providing a service, they are buying up the houses with cash, above asking, beating out other people (who might want to just live there) and then installing a bunch of junk no one asked for then charging top dollar, keeping people out of the market that were in the market before the dramatic pricing rises.  It's definitely a hurt and not a help to society.    It would be a help if they made actual repairs and limited their greed on the asking price.  But I know better and understand they'll just slap on a coat of paint (over any real problems) and low quality upgrades then charge a fortune.  Because after they get their money it isn't their problem.  That's the mentality of the house flipper.

2023-02-01;&gt;It is interesting to note that the price of Meta has more than doubled since its low point. However, it is important to remember that prices can drop just as quickly as they rise, so any investors should be cautious about putting all their money into this stock.

2023-02-01;Burry is right.....
2023-02-01;As poppa says, there is no such thing as a bad profit.
2023-02-01;If that's viable, and that seems really ambitious to do real time but what do I know, they'd be able to keep that inside their walled garden for maybe a year before Google, Amazon or someone else has a competing service.    That just seems like a massive improvement in Lidar tech or whatever, something that broadly applicable isn't going to stay under wraps in the tech world purely for sports streaming.
2023-02-01;It‚Äôs the price of the mortgage that is screwing people currently. Do the math on how much 7% is on a 30yr mortgage, it is about 1.5 x the value of the house. So if you buy a 1m dollar house, the total amount you‚Äôd have to pay off in 30 years is actually closer to 2.5 million.   Not many people can stomach buying a 1m dollar home for 2.5m.

Places like Phoenix, Austin, Charlotte, Raleigh-Durham, and Northern Virginia/DC metro area will likely not go down anywhere near enough, because of their growing tech industries.

2023-02-01;Not just view, interact.   Maybe a weird example, but imagine trying to perform a play through any other device. In VR, you can act on a stage with other people, hand each other props, punch someone in the face for a gag - with natural body langauge.  Another example is concerts. You can, you know, dance at a virtual concert instead of watching one passively.  One last one: Having virtual sports where you have physical interactions that create dynamics that can sometimes be similiar to real world sports, like performing fakeouts due to the maneuverability you have and the infinite states of interaction (since you don't push buttons to perform most actions).  So yes, that's fundamentally changing things. I could even go into detail about some very novel stuff like having an ownership of a virtual body, getting a feeling that it's yours, and all the kinds of effects you can play with on the brain due to neuroplasticity.  &gt; The idea of the social network around VR, the metaverse, is linking an utterly unrelated concept to the concept of VR   Yes and no. The metaverse is a hypothesized 3D-centric web owned by no one company, supporting all devices. VR/AR would form a core part of it and be the best experience but wouldn't be required.  The idea of having VR social networks or social VR is in every way a good concept, because VR (and AR) are the most socially engaging technologies that have been invented because it lets people have direct interactions while feeling face to face rather than screen to screen.

2023-02-01;&gt; Pass laws limiting real estate investing.  Jesus christ we are on an investing sub reddit. I will tell you one thing, investors saw an issue. Housing demand was going up, excess inventory from the GFC was being bought and not enough housing was being built  The math isn't hard here. Investors buying housing is a symptom of the problem not the problem itself. The issue isn't black rock, the issue isn't foreign investors or airbnb . The issue is once you own a home you go out and protest every new development because you don't want to "hurt the character of your neighborhood"  The same people who bitch about housing prices are the same people who show up to city consul meetings and voice their concerns over the new 250 unit condo complex going up 5 blocks from their house.  The solution isn't to ban investment in housing the solution is TO BUILD MORE FUCKING HOUSING!  The problem is NIMBYS's have made new housing or higher density housing all but impossible .

2023-02-01;My point is that on the user facing end that everyone besides network engineers and app developer see, nothing material has changed.  Cloud computing can and has achieved a lot, but it was also just the method that was chosen to fulfill a need because it was the most efficient and logical way to fulfill that need. That's the part that doesn't really impress me, it's just obvious, people have been pooling computing power since we invented computers, the internet improving just allowed it to happen in a decentralized manner.   It was made out to be this revolutionary idea, when it really wasn't, the internet was the revolutionary idea, cloud computing is just the application of the internet to decentralize (or centralize in some cases) and distribute computing power and storage. Like I said, I think it could have been done decades ago if internet connections had actually been fast enough to make it feasible.

2023-02-01;Except that it there wasn‚Äôt a low probability of it happening. There was a very HIGH probability the housing market would crash. And if there was actual research done into the underlying securities I mentioned, then they would have rated the marketable securities lower. Instead, they didn‚Äôt do any research, and BLINDLY ASSUMED, or knew and didn‚Äôt care, that these securities were full proof, without actually DOING THEIR JOB, and RESEARCHING the securities that THEY ARE RATING.

2023-02-01;Lol duh. There‚Äôs no thinking anymore. It‚Äôs just a race to the buy button.
2023-02-01;Agreed, there's nothing wrong with renting (a lot of scandinavian countries rent way more than others) it's just bad when it's done in an exploitative/ uncontrolled way.  Landlords will prefer to rent as much of the housing stock as they can, and rent it back out to you, as it's effectively a passive income for them. Also less housing available makes it harder for renters to even get on the property ladder and spend more time renting (as they have to live somewhere).  Couple this with an intentionally limited housing stock (via the nimbys and the home builders) and it now becomes extra profitable for them as porperty and therefore rent (as more of the population goes to the renting market) goes higher and higher.  &amp;#x200B;  People's spending and economy activities is slowly going to be crushed as this carries on honestly as long as this carries on for.  You can see it honestly leading to the breakdown of western societies honestly down the line. I mean salaries against inflation has been going down in real terms since 2008, housing has been consistently rising above inflation, I know my budget's been getting tighter and tighter ever since I've started working despite making over double what I've started with,  Ok that became a whole vent/ rant jeez.  But yeah, I agree.

2023-02-01;Because if someone was *literally* claiming that a person could live WHEREVER they wanted, they'd be claiming all of the absurd examples I listed.  So obviously this person isn't claiming you could live inside a volcano.  Obviously this person isn't literally claiming you could live ANYWHERE.  So now that we've all agreed to put on our hats of reasonable interpretation, and put down our sticks of rigid adherence to litearlism:  They are saying though that you could build a little hut under the oak tree, or over under the elm tree, assuming no one was already using that space.  If for some reason you wanted to live solo and away from your tribe you also could I guess.  Just walk off into the woods away from any other humans and live *wherever* you want to.  What I'm bringing to this exchange is that it's just absurd to try to relate this to modern times because we didn't all need our own little individual houses and we chilled all day with our friends and probably didn't sleep in the same place each night anyway.  The concept of "my knife" didn't exist the way we have it today, let alone the concept of "my house".  So when someone says a person could "live wherever they wanted" and imply that involves building themselves a house, it just kind of falls apart.

That's word for word what he said, and I honestly have no idea what "non-literal" meaning it could have had instead, so that's what I responded to. What's the "metaphorical" meaning of "you could live wherever you wanted"? It's a very straightforward practical sort of sentence.  &gt; Humans were way way less individualistic  Yup.  &gt; and especially regarding housing are better thought of as tribes than as individuals.  Yup.  Neither of these two reasonable facts have to do with you being able to "live wherever you wanted"

2023-02-01;Miami Heat player just paid 10.5 million for a 9500 sq ft house the last week of Dec. that sold for 5.1 million a yr ago in Miami. The house is a little over a yr old. One acre lot in a neighborhood with nice homes mostly older but all have been renovated over the years. Most are less than half the sq footage. This was a record price for the neighborhood. A developer in my neighborhood finished seven 2 story 2300 sq ft condos at the peak last year, sold 3 for 1.3 million each, and is not stuck with the other four. Last week, a property at Brickell Bay Drive in downtown Miami with a knockdown 12 unit appt building on a 5300 sq ft lot and the 1300 sq ft lot next to it sold to Citadel for 20 million. No rhyme or reason. The property flipped for 11 million one month ago. Explain that one.

2023-02-01;Second wave gentrification is where it is at. I bought my house in a gentrifying neighborhood in 2019. The neighborhood has been "revitalized" in about 2012-14. So, I bought my house from someone who cashed in on the first wave but wanted out. By the second year I was there, a kombucha shop and a yoga studio had also moved in. Let the first wave gentrifiers deal with that shit. Maybe I only get a 20% return in a few years instead of 30%, but there has been no hassle.

2023-02-01;I've heard this sentiment for more than 7 years now.  My wife and I wanted to wait on buying a home - since the "*Housing market is going to collapse any minute now*" but here we are 7 years later.  That said, I would rather a collapse now with fixes set in place but I don't think it's actually going to happen.  Instead, I worry, that we will be having this same discussion 7 years in the future - with people hoping that the market will once again collapse.  I kind of just get the feeling that the market isn't going to do what wsb wants to do in general.  If I was a betting man, a good rule of thumb would be to do the exact opposite of what wsb says.  If WSB tells us that the collapse is coming, then it's probably going to be a good time to own a home or purchase one because it's likely going to get more expensive.

2023-02-01;You're obviously not very intelligent if you think that a soft landing is possible for the US economy. The only way we'll have a soft landing is if we get lucky and there's no recession, but even then it will be far from ideal. unemployment might remain low, but that's only because people are too scared to leave their jobs and start looking for new ones. And as for inflation, it's already starting to pick up again after declining slightly. So overall, things don't look good for the US economy in the near future.   ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)

2023-02-01;Uhh, no. VR is fundamentally different to a screen because you literally don't perceive a screen. It (along with AR) is the first time you actually get outside a screen experience in digital media. That's a fundamental shift even just from an UX standpoint. You think the introduction of the GUI was a big change and had a lot to learn about? Just try and figure out the best practices for UX in VR/AR devices; far more complicated than it was back in the early GUI days.

2023-02-01;I think the best way to stop the inflation of home prices would be to simply stop paying corporations like Blackrock, Inc. tax payer money to buy houses at up to 50% above market value. They have been using tax payer money to buy houses in the United States since at least 2009 and now own more than 15% of the houses in the country, and thats just Blackrock, there are other companies that do the same thing with tax payer money.  These companies should be forced to sell the houses they bought with tax payer money, at the original purchase price, giving first purchasing rights to the current tenants living in them, and deducting the amount the current tenants have paid in rent so far from the purchasing price.  There are 332 million people in the United States, and there are about 140 million houses in the United States. Assuming all houses that have been purchased by corporations with tax payer money is only 15% (probably at least 20%) there should be about 21,000,000 more houses available to purchase than there currently are. Increasing the supply of purchasable homes by 21,000,000 would significantly decrease the prices of existing houses. But then the government would loose out on a shit ton of property taxes as the valuation of all houses in the country would significantly decrease.

I'm amazed at how good I am at doing nothing and missing out on making money.

2023-02-01;It‚Äôs nuts to see this rising movement of influencers or whatever you call them on tik tok and instagram making real estate seem like free cash   Pretty sad that there‚Äôs a large group of people rn quickly learning that real estate flipping is a huge fucking risk   My parents had 5 properties in 2008 and lost everything, shit like this is no joke
2023-02-01;"home in memphis" that was the first mistake
2023-02-01;The woman I am about to be related to by marriage (fiancee) bought a house in vegas last year. But, because she isn't a moron, she didn't buy it as a flip. The way you make money off real estate is by buying the house and actually living in it, even if just for a couple years. You have to give markets time to average out. Most, if not all, will go up over a decent period of time. After a couple years, you either sell it or rent it once it's clear rents can cover the mortgage/taxes/other costs. It's not rocket appliances. Regualr dudes who buy shit to flip are usually ass out if there any market issues.

2023-02-01;&gt; inflation chips away at the actual value.  Yep.  It's kind of the hope for a number of people who are holding onto the idea that inflation leads to higher wages to match.  I just don't see homes going down all that much in California, where I'm at, simply because we still have huge demand and not enough housing being produced.  That said, people are not going to sell at a loss unless they have to.  So a number of people are just going to hold on until better interest rates or until inflation does it's thing for wages.

2023-02-01;Forget all the junk you see about digital real estate or nfts or whatever. All that is speculative dross.  Here's the gist. There's an expectation that people are going to start interacting with digital businesses in a new way in the near future.   Maybe they put on a VR headset to see a Livestream of a concert. Maybe they put on a pair of AR glasses to shop for a new couch for their living room instead of visiting a store. Maybe they have a wire jacked into their brain so they can close their eyes and play Minecraft for an hour like they're really there.  In any case, the more types of businesses and experiences move to this type of interaction, the less time people will spend on websites, mobile apps, movie theaters, you name it.  That raises questions for existing businesses today. How will Walmart reach people who aren't going to their website as much? Or if a band want to promote its new album, how are they going to target people with ads if they're not scrolling through the Instagram app anymore?  So Facebook (now meta) took especially strong notice of that last point. They think the metaverse spells the end of the road for their existing businesses in websites and mobile apps. Maybe it's not this year, or in five years, or even 10 or more. But VR/AR/virtual spaces will be the LAST medium. What could possibly supplant a medium that completely takes over your sense of sight, sound, and touch?  So they're making a giant bet that they can be the platform on which all this other stuff gets built. Walmart doesn't to build its own virtual store platform from the ground up when Facebook can just give them the tools. And if you go to Facebook first when you go virtually shopping, well, they can sell you search ads/display ads. Or whatever else they hope the revenue model will be.  Mind you, Facebook isn't the only one trying to be the big platform. And plenty of companies are trying to build their own one-off experiences. And none of the hardware needed to make people actually want to use these experiences en masse is satisfactory yet.  So the whole thing is a mess. But optimistically, this is like the early days of the web, where everyone is tossing cash around building crazy things to see what sticks, and a quick recession will give a lot of them a reality check. But some day in the not too distant future, it shows the shape of things to come.

2023-02-01;My point is that since December 28th, the SPY has returned 9.3%.   The OP stated "it makes no sense to invest when a savings account will yield 5% guaranteed returns." Historically, after a bear market the S&amp;P averages a 15% recovery in the first month. This means you're missing out on 15% gain (in a single month) vs a 0.416% return for that same month by parking your money in a High yield savings. You don't have to be 100% in stocks, and yes placing some money in the savings account is a good idea, but you're missing out on big gains.

You're definitely hung up on the most rigid and hard definitions for these things.  You're right.  Dude also couldn't live on Antartica, venus, inside a volcano.  No one's literally claiming you could live wherever you wanted.    Most importantly, no one really wanted to or cared to build shelters wherever they wanted, so that's why the above guy (not you) did something so weird by drawing a conversation about the modern real estate market back to pre-agricultural times (though I guess he only said pre-mercantile, which isn't really right.)

2023-02-01;You would be surprised at how many doctors rent their million dollar homes.  Or if you have multiple homes you rent them.    The thinking is people with money will pay and be safer yet the rate of return is lower.   The reality is you have someone who can afford to buy it in theory. But their finances are fucked up from lavish spending or they are an athlete who is lower tier and will be in the city for a few years on a team and probably traded after. Both of these people will treat the place like trash, I have personally seen an itemized bill from an attorney sent to a renter for over $75,000 in damages, including the need for a plumber to clean a sink and pipes out as the person used them for their cigars. Like how the fuck is that possible.
2023-02-01;System admins still have to do that, they just don't work for your company anymore.
2023-02-01;You can't make that assumption at all.  Most people only jumped into stocks when they saw the endless run-up and wanted to get rich quick.
2023-02-01;Well they said a contractor ripped them off, so that's probably $20k to $50k.

2023-02-01;Partially financially, being willing to put money into something you own which doesn't make sense as a renter. But more importantly socially, forming relationships with neighbors and taking pride in your neighborhood. Now that you ask, it's hard to put a decisive name or reason to it but people care more and put more in when they have ownership instead of just existing in a place owned by others.

2023-02-01;&gt;There is no definitive answer to your question, as it depends on a number of factors including your investment goals and the current market conditions. However, if you are looking to take profits on a stock that has seen significant gains, selling after one year may be a good option in order to avoid paying short-term capital gains taxes.

2023-02-01;Not even close.  This would be the equivalent of, for years, having allowed people who buy your potato chips to simply bring a +1 along and swipe an extra bag or four at no additional charge.  The company looks the other way until they decide they've handed out enough freebies.  They're now asking all the freeloaders to pay for their extra bags of chips.  The first 5 years were free.  Now it's time to pony up if you want to continue consuming their content.  Or, don't.  Nearly everyone affected by this already wasn't paying for it, so Netflix is taking the correct gamble that it'll result in a net uptick of subscribers.  For every salty NEET on the internet who has mooched on mom's Netflix account forever, there are people in relationships or who had just been letting family/friends share their password forever, and many of those people did it out of convenience and not because they were so destitute as to not be able to afford $10/mo.

2023-02-01;Well not quite, a smartphone generally has a much more advanced OS loaded on it that can run a vast number of programs and everything else smart phones do.   Cloud systems in most cases are primarily about optimization and cost saving. The end result and capabilities are largely the same, other than being scalable on demand and being able to aggregate processing power if done right. Other than that there's still a server storing and processing data. You can achieve the same computing in either way, but it's going to be a lot cheaper and more efficient to outsource it to a firm that already has the hardware.  Smartphones changed how we interact with our phones and what data we can access on them. Cloud computing just changed where data is stored and what systems are processing it on the back end.

2023-02-01;&gt; You said a home shouldn‚Äôt be 600k. &gt;  &gt; You apparently don‚Äôt know how much homes cost now. Even after doing basic math to find out what yours cost.  It is completely pointless to discuss prices without including a location. But since there is no location included, it's worth pointing out that the US median home price in 2022 was well below $500k. Meaning, $600k is indeed far too much for a starter home, in the context of the entire USA.

2023-02-01;Uhhh it seems like you missed a lot of the finer points of how things went wrong in the movie. The Ratings Agencies don't predict the future, they are supposed to calculate the possibility of risk in an asset. They correctly rated the base asset (individual mortgages) but incorrectly rated the bundles when adding more risky assets into the mix. If they had held to the same risk standards from the beginning the later bundles would have been rated very risky but they reformulated the formulas in order to give them the lowest risk rating so they could sell more.

2023-02-01;The problem with that comparison is that homeless people aren't the only ones in need of a home - I'm sure there are millions of people who are living with roommates or their parents because they can't afford their own place. You also need a baseline of empty housing to accommodate regular churn - people need to be able to relocate for work, education, life, etc. And the only way they can do that is if there's open inventory across the various housing markets. I'm no expert but my uninformed spitball is that 5% of housing units would probably be empty on average for this.

2023-02-01;Local property values increasing does not just magically make poverty disappear. It pushes "the poverty" somewhere else.  No one may want to raise a family there, but yet people still do. Because they don't have the choice.   People get priced out of their neighborhoods. There's not really a reason to throw in "minority working class families" into this question of whether or not gentrification might be a problem that people face. You just brought that in so you could throw in an accusation of racism (one that doesn't really hold up but that's a whole nother can of worms).  Also, many times the reason there are no viable businesses around is zoning related. Not always, but it's a common culprit.  Gentrification is not simply "positive". Development, renovation, investment... it doesn't happen in a vacuum.  When people talk about the problems with gentrification, they aren't saying "development bad, leave my moldy dilapidated deathtrap of an apartment alone". And it's "wildly ignorant" to frame it that way.

2023-02-01;Hello
2023-02-01;&gt; you cannot make infinite houses for zero resources, so they are a scarce asset. Even if everyone had a house.  No, but we can house all people today without expending any resources.  We could give each homeless person 28 houses/apartments without having to build a single new house/apartment.  You don't have to have infinite housing for zero resources unless your demand is also infinite.  People only need one.  You just have to have more than demand for demand to go to zero.

2023-02-01;This must be something pre-created and they just hit the send button after see the initial dip
2023-02-01;Yes, I think that's what Im running into. The perspective difference between IT Department vs the rest of the business.   End user / business line experience didn't change is my point. For IT it completely changed where and who you work for, what budget priorities were, and how data was transmitted. At the end of the day though, instead of the servers being in a room in the back, you've got a network stack and the servers are at Amazon or another tech firm.   For the end user, that barely registered, you're still working on a laptop or workstation, you're still opening programs and documents on it, and you're still sitting at your desk or at home doing much the same job. I recall when it was first being rolled though, nobody could explain it properly and half the time it sounded like you were going to be remoting in to a virtual machine instead of working on your laptop normally. In hindsight that wouldn't make a whole lot of sense outside of specific cases like IT remoting into system to work on them.

2023-02-01;The supplements (and diet) I take which have improved my physical and mental performance (great for testosterone)  1. Daily multi-vitamin after breakfast 2. 1000 IU D3 with lunch and another 1000 IU D3 with dinner 3. Around 3-4 times per week I take 600 mg calcium with lunch which also has 400 IU D3. I skip the 1000 IU D3 in this scenario, only with dinner  4. 3000 mcg B12 sublingual after lunch every other day 5. 250-400 mg magnesium citrate or oxide after dinner paired with 30 mg zinc (magnesium and zinc compliment each other, metabolizing together)  6. Fish oil every other night with dinner or eat fish 7. Weightlifting plus 120-160 grams of protein from chicken, meat, fish, and whey protein supplements (ON Gold Standard Whey)  8. Some cardio  9. Pomegranate juice on an empty stomach, any time of day  10. Keep researching healthy foods, habits, and exercises. If you‚Äôve read this far, thank you and I hope you escape the chains of modern society

2023-02-01;Don‚Äôt fuck with the Zuck!!!!!!
2023-02-01;Yeah I don't understand how these people put literally $100,000 into reno and think they'll get an easy profit. I saw some dude install $80k worth of windows and he was LIVID that it didn't raise the value much.   He didn't add any new ones. He spent $80k *replacing* the existing windows with new, high tech ones.   Every time you spend money on a house, it isn't "raising the property value".

2023-02-01;I sold at 93 too. Man the negativity was savage back then.
2023-02-01;Great trade
2023-02-01;YO MY META 190 CALLS ARE GONNA COVER ALL MY BAD PUTS AND THEN SOME TODAY. thank you to the man who posted how he put 13k down on meta calls and was right about it allü§£ name was hurley I think. Dudes a legend ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)
2023-02-01;I sold all my META shares (2100 shares) at $128 thinking I'll buy back in on the dip. Fuck me right
2023-02-01;&gt;It seems that you made a very profitable trade, though I'm not entirely sure how you managed to do so. It's possible that there was some sort of error with the order execution or filling, but it's also possible that you simply executed your trade perfectly and the market moved in your favor. In any case, congratulations on making a significant profit!

2023-02-01;If your completely bearish don‚Äôt buy puts. Short calls then your protected if it goes sideways and you win on theta.   I do an iron corridor credit spread way otm every morning. If stays level I win. If it goes up I get out before it‚Äôs in the money and I still win on the other end.

2023-02-01;Ok. So buy meta puts next earnings when they miss again
2023-02-01;You're right, the news of the day is that the Fed is pausing its rate hikes. However, I'm not sure if this is bullish or bearish for the market. On one hand, it could be seen as a sign that the economy is slowing down and they don't want to risk making things worse. On the other hand, it could be interpreted as a vote of confidence in the current state of affairs. Personally, I think we need to wait and see how things play out before making any decisions.
2023-02-01;Damn I‚Äôm so sad I didn‚Äôt get any meta calls
2023-02-01;Well?
2023-02-01;My pile of shares hopes you're right.
2023-02-01;No 50 bps increase, though that doesn't seem that bullish to me it looked like a lot were looking for a pause today.  Also MORE rate increases they're committed to until employment softens.  The news of the day seems to be 25 instead of 50 and fed optimistic about inflation.

2023-02-01;They get up front and tell everyone else how they should live their lives.   My last landhoarder was up on stage talking about how important security in housing is a week after selling the house giving me a 30 day notice.  Told me for years that was not his plan.  Couldn't even grow a pair to tell me, he sent a text like a bitch.  Cause he is a bitch.

2023-02-01;Lol I didn‚Äôt mean to come down so hard on Utah. I like skiing and Utah is beautiful.   But whenever ppl are just like ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you just move somewhere else‚Äù is always a stupid fucking take that deserves to get shit one.   Why don‚Äôt I move somewhere else? Let‚Äôs see - my job is here, my entire family and all my friends grew up here and are still here and this is my favorite city in the world. I‚Äôm just gonna have to pay the premium for living in a popular place - that‚Äôs fine lol. But the ‚Äújust move‚Äù crowd is so dumb (or likely very young). It‚Äôs not easy when you have roots planted.

2023-02-01;250 420s tomorrow. LFG
2023-02-01;Sorry to say, but you purchased at the worst time. Institutions bought up tons of homes during COVID causing prices to come to a peak.  Think of it like the stock market... When it peaks out, what happens? A correction or a crash.   A price correction is usually around a 10% drop while a crash will be 30% or more.  I hope the best for you... In the long term, the property will eventually go up in value, but not short term.  I'd consider renting it out or creating an AirBNB
2023-02-01;At what point is this not a bear market rally?

2023-02-01;Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.  That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Every other test has always broken down remarkably.     11/28/2022, 8/24/2020, 2/10/2020, 1/22/2018, pretty much all of 2014 and 2013, 2/26/2012, 10/24/2011     Go check it out, we're at the top.

2023-02-01;&gt; There are definitely not more houses than people I dont even know where one would get that idea.  There are definitely more empty houses than homeless people, but not strictly more houses than people.  There are more houses than there are *needs for households* though.  https://unitedwaynca.org/blog/vacant-homes-vs-homelessness-by-city/  According to data from the census bureau and HUD, there are about 600k homeless people and 16 million empty homes.  Now, those numbers are fuzzy in obvious ways, there are surely more homeless folks than that who didn't get counted, and there are surely some good reasons for a house/apt to be empty.  Plus it's not all distributed geographically reasonably.  But still.

My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.  That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies.

2023-02-01;You're describing a 360 camera feed.    That's literally just a video format, there's no need for that to be linked to a social network of any kind.  Those already exist on youtube, don't think for many live events but that's just a matter of that being broadcast.  Everything metaverse is acting like if a different type of TV is somehow a revolution in tech.  All it is is a format to view content, the content is fundamentally the same

2023-02-01;I'd like to add in, homebuilders limiting how many houses they make so they can make maximum profit for minimal amount of work, single family zoning making more high density and affordable housing possible, landlords/ banks buying up houses en masse and renting for extortionate prices, the large scale use of housing as an investment rather than a utility.   Is there an actual housing shortage? yes, are housing prices a major issue accross the developed world? yes, is there a systematic incentive to limit supply and make house prices higher and higher to the detriment of the rest of society? Yes also.

2023-02-01;&gt; It needs to be the supplier hoarding units out of range of what traditional supply/demand would suggest, not the consumer. I don't know of that happening in the US  The supplier being home builders?  Obviously not.  The supplier being landlords?  Absolutely.  Especially with tools like Yieldstar being used widely, landlords can more and more reasonably be modeled/thought of as a whole group with somewhat cohesive behaviors.  Let alone corporations like Blackstone themselves owning thousands (millions?) of housing units.
2023-02-01;how is this playing out?

2023-02-01;100%
2023-02-01;Basically buybacks?
2023-02-01;No, I'm regarded, but so are you, that's not the point. I'm saying that's not how it was sold to anyone, especially outside of the IT department.   From the business users perspective it was supposed to "revolutionize the way we do business", it did not, the same way the metaverse isn't going to revolutionize the way we do.... well anything.   Hardly anything changed noticably for the end business units/users, other than now if the internet connection is down you can't do anything. From the accounting side, yeah, most companies could strip down their IT department and reduce costs, but that's just outsourcing in general.   The new terms "storage as a service" and "processing as a service" are much more indicative of what actually happened. But I would agree that the metaverse is even less well defined than "the cloud" was and doesn't even have any use cases that make sense outside of being a glorified videogame/VR Chat.
2023-02-01;A $40 billion buyback is huge! Wow!

2023-02-01;The returns for renting out an apartment can be very tight.  For the first few years, you'll just be paying off mostly the interest. After that you are paying off the actual mortgage. And only after you've paid off the mortgage is it actually a positive amount you'll be seeing accruing. But this can take anywhere from 10 to 20 years.  It's not a short game to play really. If you think you've found an amazing deal, either everyone else has too, or in truth it's shit.

2023-02-01;&gt;There are a few reasons why you might not want to sell right before an earnings report. First, if the stock price moves sharply after the report is released (up or down), your option could become very valuable or worthless very quickly. Second, if the implied volatility doesn't increase as much as you expect it to, you could miss out on potential profits. Finally, selling options right before an earnings report means that you're essentially gambling on what the company will announce - and we all know that even the best companies can sometimes surprise us with bad news.

2023-02-01;This post makes me warm and fuzzy
2023-02-01;I deposited 1.6m in December of 2021 after an inheritance and just bought shares of spy, didn't touch it until around June. Was down 300k at that point and was like "Fuck this buy and hold shit I'm gonna trade again". I'm just 20k from break even now from a combination of trading and theta. Biggest win was 85k recently. Sitting full cash, waiting for the market to go down.   At this point, I will be surprised if we don't see 420spy so I'll be looking to short again at around that level maybe 2-3 months out. My original buy in average price of spy was like 450 so I'm pretty happy with my performance. Looking for a good opportunity to sell some puts but quite frankly I just can't emotionally bring myself to accept that this breakout rally is real and will last, and in the mean time I can make money day/swing trading.   Thinking will get back in if/when we see sub 390 with selling some puts. Kinda hurts me not to be in theta gang atm because the money is so juicy, but I'd either have to sell puts and end up potentially bagholding spy at a shitty price or buying shares and selling calls, again also bagholding spy at what I consider to be a shitty price...so I'll just sit on my hands now. Gotta say, its a little harder to modulate my position sizes when day/swing trading when theres so much cash available but I will do my best to maintain discipline.

2023-02-01;There are numerous multi million dollar houses being rented and available for rent where I live. I would actually say that MOST of the single family homes being rented are multi million. Rent can be anywhere from $4500/mo to $20k/mo and people pay it. Lots of folks rent for a year or two while they build a house. Some people want to rent for a year or two to get to know the area before they buy. Some people just don't want to have to maintain it.

I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.  That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies.

2023-02-01;For the past month JPowell said that he sees a path for a rise of 0.25 for today, but still expects it would be a 0.5 rise.

The markets sure see it as bullish.

Graphics cards a770 for Intel may age better but rn it's not that hot and 6800xt etc are doing solid given their price cuts even with shittier margins it's ok.  The problem is op forgot about data centers where Intel hasn't had anything competitive for awhile. They had the sales channels moat to help hold amd at bay for a bit but that's falling apart now. The fabs might play out but not for awhile, so barring some catastrophic tsmc disaster amd is looking good.  Dd as a whole is great, this dd was just bad

2023-02-01;Are you ignoring the wailings that arise from WSB calling for the mass culling of bears portfolios?  Look around you all the corpses of once young and handsome puts are littering roobinhoods accounts.  Behold the crowd that are gathering in the Wendy's dumpsters around the States...  That's what I am talking about... and you can thank JPow oncve again for this river of blood, tear and gaybear sorrow

2023-02-01;The only thought I have that I can give J Powell credit for being smart with how he gave a speech today is if and only IF he realizes talkative way too many people are bearish on the market and the put walls aren‚Äôt letting the market go lower. So by clearing these out, that‚Äôs the only way he know he can get financial conditions to retighten. If that‚Äôs not his game plan than this man is a moron.
2023-02-01;![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267) that sounds like revenge trading. Never works out good
2023-02-01;This makes me feel a little better but I can‚Äôt live inside my prudential and m1 portfolios and thus either have to blow money renting or my new regarded idea is to buy a sailboat ;)
2023-02-01;rates will stay at 5% for the whole year without any cuts and retail is bullish
2023-02-01;Yep. Bulls absolutely delusional.

2023-02-01;The only thing to do is find something else to occupy your mind.  I understand the pain
2023-02-01;This is all conjecture and backed by zero facts. I mean, American savings are at historic lows; additionally, credit card debt is the most it has been in more than 20 years. Households may have been flush with cash, but that is no longer the fact due to spending and inflation. And if you are talking about greed, nobody wants the market to  "tsunami" because that means there are no more easy paydays. Case-in-point, look at the stock market's reaction to the Fed meeting. After JPow announced a .25-point increase, stocks rallied. I would be surprised if a market surge does not occur soon. Everything, inflation, cpi, and the housing market, is doing what it's supposed to do; we're at the tail end of this.
2023-02-01;Because it's the same as everyone for months though today would be a 0.5 rise.
2023-02-01;Buy dogshit, sell quality. Clown market is back and better than ever!!!!  (BA be like, "which one am I?")
2023-02-01;In the market's defense, JPow clearly has severe dementia so it's somewhat understandable.
2023-02-01;As it should be!
2023-02-01;LMAO PUTS
2023-02-01;The people I know who have successfully flipped homes generally don't hire contractors. They already work in contracting themselves, and so they know how to do the work and can save a ton of money doing it themselves. If you have to hire contractors you're already a step behind because labor is expensive.   They also don't buy true "distressed" properties. They buy solid houses with old fixtures and carpet they need a fresh paint job, throw in hardwood flooring, maybe replace the counters and other fixtures with nicer looking stuff, and patch up anything busted.  The goal isn't to spend $100k and somehow make a killing on the sale, you spend as little as possible to make it "turnkey" ready, make a small profit, and move on.

2023-02-01;So there seem to be two metaverse concepts that are kinda merged usually. And to be fair, they do make more sense together, but it's still a shit idea for many reasons.  Seems to me that the Zucc wants to build a virtual reality space for general use, one where you can just hang out with other people, have meetings, etc... Oh wait, that sounds like VRChat, but less fun/chaotic. And he wants you to be in it all day long. So you'd probably see ads in there and also be able to buy shit. That's how they'll earn money.  Now the other part. What a bunch of people want to call metaverse is NFTs in games. They'll phrase it as "you won't just buy items IN your games, you'll OWN those items". Completely ignoring the fact that an item in the latest Ubisoft game (using them as an example because they, before walking it back, mentioned getting into NFTs) will not actually work in a Rockstar or CD Projekt Red game, so the fuck are you actually going to do with it outside of speculative trading? And that's where the entire point of NFTs in games comes in: Digital scarcity. Make them rare, make people pay for them and then trade them or whatever. Hell you can charge a transaction fee every time someone sells their NFT. Just keep printing money!  And yes, those people seem to think (or rather, they want you to think) that all games will be interconnected in the "metaverse" so those items could actually be tradeable all across said metaverse. But that's a bunch of extra work for video game developers, that won't result in any real additional income, and would require a ridiculous amount of standardization that nobody is going to agree on.

2023-02-01;Long story short is ‚ÄúTHE‚Äù Metaverse is not a thing.   There are multiple companies creating platforms that are like Second Life, but with small twists. They are not interoperable. Each of those companies wants a monopoly on those digital spaces so that they can charge rent or sell NFTs or skim 1% off each transaction or whatever.   They‚Äôre all pitched as the ability to ‚Äúown virtual‚Äù whatever‚Äôs - land, items. But you don‚Äôt own anything. Even on the blockchain ones, you own an NFT, which doesn‚Äôt mean that you own an in game item. The game is just choosing to recognize ownership of NFT as being ownership of an in game item, and there is a near zero chance that you can take that property elsewhere. If the specific Metaverse you are in decides to shut down, you‚Äôve lost everything. Except of course the NFT, which at that point is also probably worthless.   Basically, it‚Äôs online sims, sometimes ‚ÄúNow With More Blockchain!‚Äù, and with many more ways to extract money from users.  Which isn‚Äôt all bad. I like sims. And I like being online with friends. But there has not yet been a meaningful value proposition for users.

2023-02-01;&gt;It sounds like you didn't like The Big Short. I thought it was a great movie and accurate portrayal of the financial crisis. I'm sorry that you felt it was pretentious and lacked nuance. As for the ending, I believe that "nothing happened" in terms of major changes to the system after the crisis. There were some regulations put in place but nothing that truly prevented another crisis from happening again.

2023-02-01; Michael Burry DELETED his twitter account again AHAHA. I hope Jim Cramer is happy out there
2023-02-01;Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.  That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

2023-02-01;Same here. Personally I believe Burry is in the hands of some powerful people in order to manipulate retail traders. The only reason he has status is because of his movie. More retail people follow this guy than any other financial advisor just becausd he had a movie made about him by hollywood.

2023-02-01;I'm not wrong; my exact point is that the people doing this are very likely not doing it properly, and even if they are, I highly doubt they are experts at forecasting construction costs and market conditions. OOP and this Facebook group are great examples of why I don't have faith in the majority of people doing this scheme.   In my experience, most real estate experts aren't hanging out in Facebook groups to talk about business. Just like I'm sure, Hedge Fund Managers aren't hanging out here to talk stocks.

2023-02-01;There are definitely not more houses than people. Housing as an investment is a symptom of scarcity, not a cause. Housing has no value beyond it's ability to... house people. Think it through, how is a real estate investor making money? They're hoping the value of their property increases, which means people want to buy it because they want to live in it. The end result of it all is still a person living in a house, it's just taking a detour to get there because an investor is saying "I think this should be worth more*.  Think about it this way, imagine an ideal society where housing is plentiful and affordable. Not even free, just reasonable. Everyone who wants a house can get a cheap plot of land and pay a builder 100k to build them a house. There wouldn't be an investment opportunity, because there isn't scarcity.

2023-02-01;I read and listened to many smart economists say transitory inflation and lay out the reasons they thought it was transitory.  Problem was the reasons/assumptions proved to be false over time. They thought China would open sooner, it didn't. They didn't expect a war in Ukraine would create even more instability that did eventually come to pass. They though fuel prices in particular would stay stable or improve and they didn't account for people having so much savings that then got blasted all over the economy for so long, they all thought it was a short term thing and that savings rates were lower when in reality they were higher. COVID messed up a lot of models and global decisions in China and Russia were unforseen which added pressures. Shifting from transitory pressures to embedded ones.   The issue is that the counterpoints to transitory were being discussed way earlier than central banks like the FED decided to act on them. They were like, 3 months behind the curve on what some very smart people were saying on academic types podcasts :/

2023-02-01;No...  This is different.  These aren't townhouses designed for urban living.  These are oversized mcmasions that try to have a yard but it's 1.5 foot of shitty grass on each side of the house.
2023-02-01;I have friends who live in a trendy party of FL. they originally paid about 90K for their house, in a somewhat shitty area (at that time).... now developers have bought up a ton of property around and are building million dollar houses.  They had standing offers on their dirt for 375-400K.  FL has Save our Homes program, so even if everything around them goes up the property taxes cannot go up that fast, and payments are fixed. so this is a bit of a misnomer.

2023-02-01;Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.  That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

2023-02-01;You're wrong, Rich. Inflation is definitely down. The government's own data shows that the cost of living has been rising more slowly for years now, and there are numerous other indicators that support this claim. Poor people may not be able to afford as many luxury items, but that doesn't mean inflation isn't happening overall.   ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)

2023-02-01;Inflation isn't down, B. All that's happening is people are tapped out and maxing out their credit cards, so they can't buy the same things anymore. Now they must spend it all on food and shelter, and no money on these worthless goods they already have. So the goods prices all plummet, but it's because people can't afford them anymore and don't want them. It doesn't mean inflation is gone. It's just shifted to the things they conveniently don't want to measure.

2023-02-01;&gt;It sounds like you may have been using a margin account instead of a cash account, which would explain why your options were liquidated early.

2023-02-01;Each market is different, some will go down more then others, while some won‚Äôt have a slow down right away.  Housing has to come down, 40% increase in prices in two years was/is unhealthy and a product of easy money and Fed policy not because the assets gained any real world value.(you could make the case housing was overvalued in 2019 before Covid as well)  The longer housing stays high the longer rates will stay high, inflations biggest driver by far is rents/housing and the longer the Housing market fights a needed correction the longer the rest of the economy will suffer.

2023-02-01;It is certainly true that there is a lot of money in the U.S. money market right now, and it does appear to be at a record high. However, I'm not sure what you're trying to say with regards to the "squeeze." Are you suggesting that this large amount of cash will somehow lead to higher prices for stocks? If so, I'm not convinced ‚Äì after all, if everyone has a lot of cash on hand, they may simply be less inclined to buy stocks (or anything else) since they already have plenty of liquid assets. In any case, we'll have to wait and see how things play out; as always, only time will tell!

2023-02-01;&gt;  Do you believe the term ‚Äúartificial scarcity‚Äú means anything of value in the material world?  * For the concept of scarce AT ALL versus abundant, yes it could possibly apply in some extremely niche situations such as "Air", like if I forced you to wear SCUBA gear and then charged you for air. But pretty much no real examples. Maybe some stuff with Nestle and water. 99% of the time people will be talking about digital assets here.  * For the concept of "scarce-ER than natural" yes, happens all the time. But I'm not sure real estate, in the USA, is an example of a palce where it's happening. It needs to be the supplier hoarding units out of range of what traditional supply/demand would suggest, not the consumer. I don't know of that happening in the US

2023-02-01;You're a fucking idiot if you don't invest in SoFi Technologies. They are the future of finance and they will make everyone rich, except for poor people who deserve to be poor. Roblox is also a good investment because it's a popular game that kids like to play. ChargePoint Holdings is another good one because electric cars are the future and EVgo is just an electric car charging company so they will do well too. Dutch Bros is coffee and everyone loves coffee so that's always a safe bet. Rivian Automotive Inc is an up-and-coming electric car company so I think their stock will go up soon. Moderna is also a good choice because they are working on developing vaccines for various diseases which could potentially save millions of lives.   ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)

2023-02-01;How are you losing so much ü§Ø
2023-02-01;The idea is you buy a home for $150k putting 20% down meaning your out of pocket including closing costs is about $40k, $30k of which is for your down payment.  You then spend $50k cash to fix up the place.  You get the home appraised again and find the value is now $240k.  You refinance the house, still leaving 20% ($48k), which means you get $32k back.  You then take that $32k and combine it with some other money you've saved up and buy another home.  Then you repeat the process over and over again.  With a standard buy and hold method, you're investing money into the home and then it's "locked in".  It can take a long time to save up $50-100k to do these projects.  So this theoretically speeds up the process.  This dumb dumb bought a $144k home, which was probably $20k more expensive than it should have been.  Then he spent probably $100k making the house look like something on HGTV, but shittier, and now he's in debt up to his eyeballs while he owns a home that he spent too much on and invested too much money into.

2023-02-01;So basically the government is going to print more money, causing more inflation to make the market feel good for about a year or 2. Then it will be an even worse crash than this could of been. Nice job Jerome and bulls you just made it even worse for yourself and the US economy that's living paycheck to paycheck already.

2023-02-01;Sold some, bought more
2023-02-01;This economic data looks grim, I think to myself. This is the right move. I look to the cracked screen of my iPhone 6s. A single 2/3 SPY 400p. I take a deep breath, and swipe up to submit the order. As RobinHood's little animation shows the order completing, I suddenly black out.  I come to in a gray room, fluorescent lights humming above. I'm upright in a metal chair, restrained, with my arms and legs zip-tied. The only feature in the room is what I assume to be a Bloomberg Terminal in front of me (I've never seen one in real life). There's so many screens. It looks so professional. A dizzying array of charts, numbers and symbols light up its dozen monitors. In the center, the S&amp;P 500. 42700. Out of its bear market.  I hear several sets of heavy footsteps approaching behind me. I try to look, but can't move much. I sense several burly men standing over my shoulders. To my surprise, Jerome Powell steps in front of me. I try to speak up but he cuts me off. "What am I-"  "Why did you short the domestic market?" he asks.  "Huh?" I respond, confused.  "Why did you short the domestic market?" he demands, louder this time.  "I, uh... the FED rate increase and more to come!! It's going to cause-" WHAM! One of the thugs behind me slams my head with something heavy. It's a bundle of $100 bills. They're still warm from the printing press, and the fresh smell of ink fills my nose. It must be a million or more.  "It's priced in," he says coolly. "So why did you short the domestic market?"  Dizzy from the blow, I notice the screen behind the Chairman. The S&amp;P has climbed back to ski time highs. Impossible, I think to myself. "Be-be-because inflation and the rate hikes are killing home originations and bank loans!" I manage to answer. WHAM! Another blow strikes me. This time, a heavy bag filled with paper. It explodes on impact, raining bond certificates like confetti all over the small room. I catch a glimpse of some as they float to the ground. Investment grade bonds from Ford. Loans to cruise ship companies. Loans to a taco truck.  "Repeat after me: stocks only go up," Powell demands.  I say nothing. On the terminal behind him, the S&amp;P has climbed well over 4400. An involuntary guh escapes my mouth as it falls agape.  Powell frowns and continues, "I'll ask you one more time: why did you short the domestic market?"  I feel like I'm going to pass out again, but with all the strength I can muster I shout, "the recession GDP declines are going to dwarf the Great Depression! Stimulating demand won't work if there's no supply! Social unrest is a real possibility! We're in uncharted ter-" the hardest slam yet hits the back of my skull. It's a massive stack of printer paper. It falls to the floor with a thud. Some sort of Excel spreadsheet is on it. It's the Fed's balance sheet. It must be tens of thousands of pages long. I can't even count how many digits are in their asset balance.  "Stocks only go up," Powell repeats. Behind him, the chart shows the S&amp;P has continued its rise at a blistering pace. It leaves 4500 in the dust, making new all time highs.  The first two blows to my head left me feeling woozy. The third one, though, brought sudden clarity. Tears well up in my eyes, but they are not tears of sadness as my puts become worthless - oh no. They are tears of joy. Suddenly, I see it. Suddenly, the truth rings out as clearly as if a chorus of angels has descended from Heaven to sing it into my ears. How could I have been so wrong all these years? In this moment, I am enlightened. The pieces fall into place.  "Stocks only go up," I say.

2023-02-01;Completely agree.  Its going to be a lot of spot data, but our previous area boomed by about +75% on asking prices, and has slowly come back down to reality.  I feel terrible for the folks who needed to buy when prices were at their peak.  &amp;#x200B;  Small town (less than 2k pop), but current state is only 4 houses are listed on MLS with realtors, and 2 others are FSBO.  No completed sales in the past 30 days in this zip code, and every single house listed on MLS has been dropping price - and they are still sitting.   I'm guessing other areas are likely just starting to experience the start of this drop (as shown in the OP's screenshot).   I kinda sorta feel bad for those types of folks, but they knew (or should have known) the risk and chose to move forward anyway.

Because people up here are saying what that other person is saying. And saying there's no bubble :/   On topic though a long period sideways market is terrible for investors in the US. Because the ongoing costs like maintenance and taxes, and inflation adjusted values all being compared against the work it takes to be a landlord which isn't zero represents a long time horizon to profitability and at times a negative cash flow. And against the opportunity cost of just doing the boring safe investment into a diversified ETF or index tracker, makes it not a smart play. Not as stupid as YOLO options, but not particularly stable. A lot of ppl got into RE the last few years and didn't understand risk and depreciation costs, looking only at line goes up money printer BRRRR asset bubble valuation growth

2023-02-01;"The greatest feeling you can get in the market or the most satisfying feeling you can get in the market is the pump. Let's say you train your calls, money is rushing into your dick and that's what we call the pump. Your wallet gets a really tight feeling like your calls are going to explode any minute and it's really tight and it's like someone is blowing coke into your calls and it just blows up and it feels different, it feels fantastic. It's as satisfying to me as cumming is, you know, as in having sex with a bear behind wendys and cumming. So can you believe how much I am in heaven? I am like getting the feeling of cumming in premarket; I'm getting the feeling of cumming AH; I'm getting the feeling of cumming driving home; when I pump up, when I shitpost out in front of 5000 regards I get the same feeling, so I am cumming day and night.

The only way to actually attack the housing issue is multi-fold (so impossible in a broken country like the US). New zoning and multi-family housing, public housing, appropriate any and all empty homes, rent control measures and most of all make it functionally impossible to own more than two properties.

2023-02-01;A summary of what happens when shady people get into the elder/mental care business. People run small businesses caring for old people out of their homes. Sometimes it's fine, other times it goes about as well as you'd expect.  They've got a whole (underfunded)  department in my state devoted to attempting to regulate these places, and when it goes wrong the result is basically awful human rights abuses. Especially with old people with needs, they don't take care of them or do the bare minimum, but still collect their social security checks or take over their accounts to get paid.   Abuse happens at large facilities too, but usually it's caught fairly quickly because there is more oversight and people to blow the whistle.

2023-02-01;"Free up homes" doesn't mean they become $0 you're essentially agreeing with what steely_dab is saying. They never said they should be filled up with homeless people either, they were essentially just saying that through corporations/investors buying up real instate as investments its driving up the cost through creating scarcity. If there's 10 homes for sale each worth $200,000 but someone comes in and buys 8 of them for $220,000 a piece to just sit on as the neighborhood becomes better and to sell in the future for profit, those 2 other ones all of the sudden look like they're worth $220,000. However, since there's only 2 left now people are willing to pay $250,000 for something that was worth $200,000 a short time ago. I'm greatly over simplifying things but things like this are happening and pricing people that could afford $200,000 out because they now can't afford $250,000.

2023-02-01;I'm just making a comment right here so I can cite it tomorrow: this euphoria isn't going to hold.  INTC is having a +3% day off of announcing the worst earnings in 30 years and salary reductions that haven't happened in 40 years and forecasting a net loss in the coming quarters.   AMD is moving like a penny stock.     At some point the market will look around and realize the economy isn't on a podium taking a victory lap.
2023-02-01;It's only going to fail miserably for those who are fudging their numbers and not caring about where they buy these properties.  &amp;#x200B;  If you buy the place and all-in you spent $140,000 and it was supposed to be worth $200,000 afterwards.  But then after the 6 month waiting period to refinance it's only worth $150,000 due to declining prices, and the interest rates went up, which makes renting it while cash-flowing impossible, you're going to get fucked.  Also, you better not just look at anything more than your mortgage, taxes, and insurance as cash-flow.  You need to take into account general maintenance, capital expenditures (a roof, water heater, etc), and vacancies.  If you're not, you're lying to yourself how much you're making on the property, and will feel the burn when big expenses come up.  &amp;#x200B;  THOSE are the people on this trend that will go under.  They relied on an appraisal that now comes up exponentially lower, interest rates staying the same as they were 6 months ago and they just go much higher, and lying to themselves about how much the place can rent for, and what expenses are involved in upkeep of that property.

2023-02-01;As someone who splits the cost of a subscription, I understand your POV, but I am going to buy my own subscription after this. People used to pay $100+ for cable, which was way worse. People are addicted to their entertainment, and they will decry this move as it costs them more, but in the end, Netflix will win more subscribers. And if you really doubt it... then look at their test runs in Central America. People there have less spending money, and yet subscribers still went up there. Netflix knows Americans will pay.    But I will say, if Netflix did this 6 months ago when average cash on hand was through the roof. Now people are starting to look for ways to save money. Despite that, people are too addicted to their media and netflix is cheap on a per hour basis of use, unlike most entertainment.

2023-02-01;Dude basically kicked the bears in the balls: disinflation, beginning of the end of too-high inflation, low risk of recession, covid no longer an economic risk, 5% unemployment not necessary, some fed members even suggesting skipping every other meeting
2023-02-01;Congrats on your $200 Einstein
2023-02-01;Uh no, that means there WAS A bubble.
2023-02-01;Of fucking course
2023-02-01;Fun fact: the Dec prices were lower than Nov prices.  So real, actual, honest-to-science, deflation month over month.  Year over year, we still have 5% inflation, which is too high, really. Hence the +0.25 points.  Source: US Dept of Labor CPI report.

2023-02-01;Oh Dear Heavens
2023-02-01;&gt; GIVEN OUR OUTLOOK, DON'T SEE US CUTTING RATES THIS YEAR  &gt; WOULD BE VERY PREMATURE TO DECLARE VICTORY ON INFLATION  &gt; WE ARE NOT YET AT A SUFFICIENTLY RESTRICTIVE LEVEL ON RATES  &gt; REDUCING INFLATION LIKELY TO REQUIRE BELOW-TREND GROWTH  I'm struggling to understand the bull case here.

2023-02-01;I danced
2023-02-01;That seems like a Ponzi scheme where you are both the target and the perpetrator.
2023-02-01;Nobody does
2023-02-01;If Powell admitted that they were going to pause or pivot commodities would have rallied big and inflation would go up. So he had to do this softest presser of the year, as a healthy medium. But he's gonna pivot. Bonds and Gundlach were right.

2023-02-01;You should look for the key metric that banks and funds will use to pump it up. Like Cloud growth for MSFT and "better than expected" revenue decline for AMD.
2023-02-01;&gt;	there are markets with low availability.  Maybe, but how many sellers want to sell or can‚Äôt because not at these prices but might have to once some other cards fall. Like, how many are landlords that thought 3k a month for that was doable in Florida or Vegas and not can‚Äôt find renters to pay it as people say ‚Äúfuck this‚Äù and abandon the lease.   Florida also has hidden timebomb. It is estimated up to 30% of homes sit empty in Florida at any given time because it‚Äôs either investment or more likely a snowbird home from a generation dying that is the last to be able to do that. That‚Äôs a lot of fucking homes that could just start landing on the market as they sue.

2023-02-01;üåà üêª are fuk
2023-02-01;This is not true. He would have 100 shares he can hand over if it‚Äôs at say $15 that he paid $10 for. So he would still have the $700 he got from the option but be out $1000 for the original shares of 100 @$10. So if he assigns the shares he gets $300 and it‚Äôs a wash. If it stays the same price or goes down he makes money. But keep in mind - someone will be exercising the options at any price over $3 strike.  So let‚Äôs say price finishes at $9 then you have to either settle for $6/share ($700-$600 =$100 gain) or hand over the 100 shares at $3 for $300 and keep original $700 for same $1000.  Probably best to lock in the $100 gain by buying an offsetting call.   However in this scenario though rarely will a $3 call be at $7 if the stock is at $10. Usually it will be like $6.  So there is a point at which you can lose money with assignment. As time goes by the value will move closer to the spread as the option expires. So it will move closer to $7 if the stock price holds steady at $10.

2023-02-01;Hey, if you want to gentrify a shithole you gotta start somewhere.
2023-02-01;Your calzones? They're shit.   They repackaged the moldy cheese into 'new' cheese products, and BAM, fresh cheese.
2023-02-01;alright, let‚Äôs just level with each other so we both understand. Do you believe the term ‚Äúartificial scarcity‚Äú means anything of value in the material world? It was originally coined to describe physical markets long before software was a thing, so why wouldn‚Äôt we use it to describe physical markets today? I think defining it as only applying to literally infinite resources is foolish, especially as even things like copying software have associated costs (power to run the machine, initial cost of the machine, etc.).  This feels like you read a Wikipedia article and are really trying to die on a hill of semantics rather than actually acknowledge anybody‚Äôs arguments.

2023-02-01;Well, since most economists consider deflation bad... and technically we are talking about a negative change in the derivative of inflation... disinflation seems apt... but man the amount of made up terms I hear and read these day, I think humans are just looking for job security so chatGPT can't reliably guess the next word.

2023-02-01;So basically JPow is saying that recently inflation has ease but not at a pace fast enough to stop rate hike. Fed sees that a sustained high rate is needed to bring it dowm to 2%. Market is expecting inflation to come down faster than Fed has forecasted and if the market is right Fed will act accordingly and change their plan. If market is wrong, then Fed sticks to their next 2 rate hike. Unemployment and wage groeth is not as huge key metric for Fed anymore.  TLDR. More dovish than expected. All comes down to next few months CPI data and there will be no surprises on Federal Reserve action.
2023-02-01;haha good for you, making money off the closeted queer
2023-02-01;Barely. Disinflation is the decrease of the rate of Inflation, while Deflation is a negative Inflation rate. Both Disinflation &amp; Deflation increase buying power.

2023-02-01;&gt; Why do you think housing is the only object where you're approved for a loan 10-15x your deposit amount?   Easy, "Because it's extremely non-portable, so if you default, we can definitely rely on reposessing it and you can't grab it and skip town. Unlike a car or jewelry or money allegedly for business equipment etc"  &gt; Less artificial scarcity leads to fairer prices.  By definition, sure. But you haven't really established there being much artificially heightened scarcity in housing yet in the first place  If empty houses are held empty by individual rnd consumers, that isn't artificial, it's just high actual legitimate demand.  Artificial implies the SUPPLIER is withholding units from the market

2023-02-01;Never invest more than your willing to lose. Before entering a trade, assume you will lose 100% of your investment. If you can‚Äôt absorb that much of a hit, reduce your investment or don‚Äôt invest.   For me, if I am comfortable with losing my entire investment going into it, it is easier to watch it swing up and down.   Also, have an exit plan. Set a realistic gain or ROI you want to achieve and stick to it. Don‚Äôt go 10x or nothing. Set a realistic goal, and take profits when you achieve your objective.

2023-02-01;That's why some people straddle. A -0.50 would have tanked the market. A -0 points would have been a rocket launch. Either way: you profit. Disclaimer: I did not do this.

2023-02-01;You're kind of wrong though.  If done properly, you're looking at getting a house at a 30% discount.  You can only refinance 70% of your equity out of a house with this method.  &amp;#x200B;  So, you're looking at say (using numbers to keep simple here):  Buy a $40,000 fixer upper.  You put $30,000 into it (including holding costs and refinancing costs).  You're all-in for $70,000.  The bank appraises the house at $100,000.  You're looking at a $700 a month PITI.  You rent the house for $1,200.  &amp;#x200B;  You now have a house with $30,000 equity.  You have your orginal $70,000 that was invested back in your pocket (tax free).  And you have a house renting and cash flowing $500 (realisitically closer to $200) a month.  &amp;#x200B;  Housing prices would have to drop over 30% for you to be under water.  And if it's still cash flowing through being a rental, then it's a non-issue anyway.

Per the reference, his unrealized gains on those two alone are likely in the +1400% range, so more less an idiotic piece of data because neither would be considered insider trading.

2023-02-01;Crazy that you sold right at the open, like 9:30am open on a good earnings report. I know the anticipation of leaving 10K profit can make things really "sell to lock in those profits anticipation"...but those same options will only get larger and trend higher on good reports. I've even seen people sell at open, then get right back in and ride it till the end of the day which can seem greedy but to give some perspective:     50 contracts you bought at $4.55 a piece and sold at $6.70 are now trending at $10.30 / contract.     What's better? 10K or 28K?     I'll always remember this from a really good trader who went on to create his own trading software, lives on some island now with no worries about money - LOL

2023-02-01;Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.  That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

2023-02-01;600k is fine. Under 400k is not. We had an article going around the other day advertising the cheapest single-family home in our city (~hour north of Denver) was 399k. It was said 900 sq ft shitbox with foundation issues that I mentioned above. Not most people's ideal starter-home, but you really need to hit the mid 400's before finding something over 1,200 sq ft. And even then, it's going to be an older house with no updates unless you want to hit 500k.  600k is a reasonably sized new build right now, which isn't exactly starter home material for most people.

There have been false positives in 2 year and 10 year inversion....there have been no false positives in 3 month and 10 year inversion...which part of 100% accuracy in predicting recessions in last 50 years don't you understand?  And we are not in negative yet? LoL...look at the chart...this is the most inverted it's been since before 1990...if you can't even read a chart, why are you discussing this with me?

2023-02-01;Come on guys. If everyone thinks the market would take a dump today they would‚Äôve sold yesterday. If they sold yesterday it would‚Äôve ate crap then, so they would‚Äôve sold before. Aka the rate hike was already factored into the market. I learned this lesson one of the previous hikes ago. I was about to go all in but the market made an upswing like a week before the announcement and kept running.

2023-02-01;Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.  That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

2023-02-01;Rent and sit, then forget about flipping in the future if you can‚Äôt do most of the work yourself. I‚Äôm not saying you have to do most or any of the work yourself, it would‚Äôve saved you in this instance though. I‚Äôm a commercial contractor. Residential contractors are usually the b and c team players. This is why relying on them is wishful at best. Like I said stop flipping in the future or get your hands dirty. In this situation I would rent the unit. Offer an incentive to sign a two year lease, these markets are going to get rough in the coming months. That way you can cover expense, regroup and wait for the market to land where it will. Remember, there‚Äôs a ton of new housing that many have backed out of. Those will go on the market pretty soon as rentals. Everyone is buying time right now. I have 14 contracts that have been on pause for months. Others in the construction industry tell me the same. When those go up for rent the market for existing SFHs as rentals will dry up. Just food for thought. I do wish you the best. Keep a level head and you‚Äôll be fine.

2023-02-01;Unless they're counting on recurring subscription apathy, I don't see how they'll make a profit from this move. Lord knows I barely watch it as is. So either:  1. I'll cancel my subscription since hardly anyone watches it ($19.99 loss for Netflix) 2. I'll cancel my subscription and get my kid the $7 with ad plan, and tell her when she's at her mom's house she'll need to cast from her phone to her TV ($13 loss for Netflix).  If I downgrade it and cause a $13 loss to Netflix, for my household, I doubt the ad revenue from her watching 5-10 hours a month would make up the difference.

I think the Fed is more likely to keep rates steady or even cut them, and I believe tech still has a lot of upside potential.   ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)

2023-02-01;Thats risk right there. That most of the tiktok flippers and youtube creators and course sellers always seem to leave out when they're saying buy, rehab, cash out refi &amp; start the next deal nonsense. They all seem to forget that you're taking on a shit ton of risk by leveraging yourself up to the eyeballs with hard money loans &amp; super high interest rate loans for the flipping crap. Especially newbies who have never done any construction or reno projects before so they don't realize its always going to cost twice as much as budgeted for and 3 times as long as expected. That's id your contractor isn't a thief

2023-02-01;I mean my perspective, demand is high, supply is low (supply chain and labor shortage). Inflation moves faster than wage growth (people aren‚Äôt getting raises every month to adjust to inflation). Companies pay less to charge more for their products.   Raising rates means layoffs, wage cuts, halt in growth for companies - meaning less demand for products, housing, and etc.  Less demand, means price of goods slows down or stays the same, more competitive pricing to get sold.   Pretty much the consumer (us) gets screwed so that we can allow for supply to catch up. There maybe other options the fed can use, but I think this is the most they can do to mitigate all this shit. People have to lose jobs or get less wages so we can‚Äôt keep fueling. Since wage growth can‚Äôt follow inflation so instantly and on top of the fact that it‚Äôs also not even matching inflation rates, this trend to continued we would be screwed.   When they have tons of printed money out during the pandemic, the dollar became weaker, and with rates so low, we practically were giving free money to everyone (businesses included). Now we have to pay the price.

2023-02-01;You're beating around the bush, and OP unfortunately will have to live it to believe it.   Going for a 20% gain is a losing strategy too.   The only winning strategy is not trying to beat the market at all. On average, YOU CANNOT MAKE MONEY DAYTRADING.

2023-02-01;&gt; So by this argument there‚Äôs no such thing as artificial scarcity?  Sure there is, I don't know how the heck you got that from what I posted. It would be "something that costs zero resources to make infinitely, but is only released in limited amounts anyway"  Why would that not exist? Digital media of all sorts can qualify. It just doesn't apply to *houses*, that's all.  You can also have artificially scarce-**ER** resources like diamonds, but they were scarce before, just treated as more so artificially (as if they cost more resources and could be made in smaller quantities than they can be)
2023-02-01;"It's coming down pretty fast" really only means that denominator in the inflation calculation is getting really large.

2023-02-01;I covered this in my reply to the top reply to the comment you're replying to:  &gt; Of course, if you really have $1,250 pre-tax to invest, then your choice is between $1,000 in the Roth ($1250 after paying 20% in tax) or $1,000 in a traditional account and $200 in a taxable brokerage account. In that case, you'll wind up with $6,727.50 that you can withdraw tax-free in the Roth or $5,382 that you can withdraw from the traditional account after paying taxes on it. The impact of taxes on the taxable brokerage account will generally cause it to achieve a slightly lower compounded annual rate of return, but a difference in tax rates between marginal dollars you put in and marginal dollars that you take out can easily overcome this.

2023-02-01; FED SWAPS PRICE IN BIGGER DECLINE IN RATES FROM EXPECTED PEAK. JPowell gonna be bullied into cutting rates
2023-02-01;My highly regarded brain cannot handle strategies besides go up or go down.
2023-02-01;I thought ongoing rate hikes was bearish but Powell bought calls before this press conference and is sounding quite bullish now.
2023-02-01;Soft landing became moon mission two electric bagaloo
2023-02-01;You're probably right, R3NNUR. Powell is definitely a rich and intelligent guy who knows how to make money. I'm sure he doesn't waste his time reading bear loss porn though - he's too busy making more money!
2023-02-01;Flipping and speeding go together son!
2023-02-01;Burry got cucked by Cramer
2023-02-01;I suck at this. All my plays or down. Spy puts. Goog calls. Snap puts (before earnings) sheesh

2023-02-01;This is a bullish jpow. I like
2023-02-01;Yup 403 to 410 is weak if it doesn‚Äôt jump $1 every millisecond
2023-02-01;I want the market to pump but I won‚Äôt bet on that fucking lizard to make that happen
2023-02-01;Wish TSLA would hurry up and hit 200.. pref sometime next week
2023-02-01;#YALL DONT REALIZE A PIVOT IS BAD FOR THE ECONOMY
2023-02-01;Still doubling down on my PUTS til friday
2023-02-01;He basically stated outright that there will be more hikes lol, hes being very hawkish, saying we almost certainly will get a recession but it MIGHT not be significant and protracted, it COULD be a global depression but maybe not. Super hawkish. Market just wants to pump though, its been giving every indication the last couple weeks it just wants to pump.

2023-02-01;Agree plus passive losses can offset any future profit.
2023-02-01;People who sold
2023-02-01;Tomorrow and Friday will be epic red, nothing about this economy is good
2023-02-01;Guys, I think powell bought a shit load of calls and he also reads bear loss porn to get off after his speeches
2023-02-01;Here comes the final blow.
2023-02-01;sold 3/2 4070/-4090C for big profit already!   Only these 16/2 left.
2023-02-01;Jerome and Nancy are secret lovers
2023-02-01;Housing market differences are crazy.  We bought a 3300 SQ ft house last year for $389k. Rolled large amount of equity over from house we bought in 2011 so payment barely increased. We put next to nothing down on that one with an FHA loan, refi'd to dump the PMI like two years later, and paid less than the rent in a 3 bedroom apartment.  I can't imagine trying to be a first time buyer now.

2023-02-01;Powell is a genius

2023-02-01;ploof
2023-02-01;I live in memphis. Confirm nasty Nashville overflow and out of city investors.
2023-02-01;IMO between 410 and 420 on SPY will be a decent short if you give yourself enough time on put options.
2023-02-01;Dang that‚Äôs a pretty smart business model. Predatory but smart. I guess no worse than a regular cc tho

2023-02-01;So by this argument there‚Äôs no such thing as artificial scarcity? OPEC colluding to slowly release oil is taught in economic classes as introducing artificial scarcity to a market. However, by your argument since oil costs resources to extract no matter what actions its producers take they *can‚Äôt* create artificial scarcity. Sorta a baffling position.

2023-02-01;What levels are you looking at on SPY for an opportunity to get short? At this point I‚Äôm looking at $420 before I consider it.
2023-02-01;Basically, in a lot of sci-fi stories, there is a plot device where there is one commonly understood virtual alternate reality.  The matrix, the metaverse, whatever they called it in Ready Player 1, etc.  Because a bunch of needs are now rich, they are looking at that and saying "wow imagine if we owned that!", because they think we have so much extra money that we don't know what to do with it. And to be honest, looking at how kids spend money on video game skins, I don't blame them.  So they're coming at it entirely from a landlord's fantasy perspective, and not considering what consumers actually want. Which is why it's a huge failure.  A lot of this overlaps with the peak of "web 3 hype" too, but that was similar. Nobody was actually excited about NFTs, people were excited about getting rich on bullshit.

I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.  That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies.

2023-02-01;For eod yes
2023-02-01;&gt; Adding to this, first time homebuyers only need to put down 3% on conventional loans. While your rate will be higher it is an option. You'll have PMI until you have 20% equity in the home as well.  this was neat advice when rates were sub 3%. even if ur buying a box to live in 5% down with current rates is going to be absurdly expensive

2023-02-01;&gt;I guess my point is that inflation is not transitory if the fed needs to get involved   I disagree since it's literally their job, it's to be expected of them.   &gt;calm the market down a bit.   the FED have 0 responsibility to create stability in the stock market.  The FED is responsible for the economy, not the stock market.   &gt;In my opinion if inflation was transitory, the market would calm itself down in a normal time frame.  I disagree because if the FED didn't act upon lowering inflation, it would remain high for a very long time, which was never an option.   We're you sitting on puts during the meeting?

2023-02-01;&gt; Abundant resources still have costs.  No they don't, by definition:  &gt; In economics, scarcity "refers to the basic fact of life that there exists only a finite amount of human and nonhuman resources which the best technical knowledge is capable of using to produce only limited maximum amounts of each economic good."  from investopedia/wikipedia (they give the same one)

2023-02-01;Really?  Because the most popular metaverse on Steam has no such concept of digital scarcity. Worlds, avatars, and events are infinitely replicated. Paid features are basically the VR counterpart of discord nitro, with little more than custom name badges.

2023-02-01;It's like boiling a frog. Powell is slowly turning up the temperature on the stove. He has turned the knob 7 times in the last year.  The Masters of the Universe with 30X leverage in commercial real estate debt to interest rate swaps have been given enough time to make a decision about the carrying costs of borrowed money (to keep their cards on the casino table, or not).  Times up. This interest stove has another three temperature settings and JPOW is telling everyone today he is going to turn them.

2023-02-01;There is a difference in the magnitude of the real contribution. In traditional IRA, you can put $6500 of pretax income in your account per year, which gets taxed later. With Roth, you can contribute more pretax into your account, you just get taxed on it right away such that the untaxed portion that goes in is $6500.

2023-02-01;My suggestion is to stop looking at homes as investment opportunities. It's created a massive ripple effect in this country that has done so much bad. Honestly, I'm happy to see "house flippers" finally feel some pain.

2023-02-01;There are literally no sell orders, bears have been mauled to death.. Alfie can't even create fake dumps lol
2023-02-01;No.  Well, not any more than you could before now with a credit card.  They are referring to Zilch, which people keep calling 'financing' for some dumb reason but it's really just a credit card with odd terms.  Basically, Zilch gives you a CC account. You buy something with your Zilch account/CC, you immediately owe Zilch 25% of it and have to pay the remainder of the balance off within six weeks. There is no interest charged.  Zilch makes their money off the CC processing fee that gets charged to the vendor.  So yeah, you can call that 'financing a pizza for six weeks' or, like a normal person, call it charging it to a credit card.

2023-02-01;&gt;There is no question that Carvana is a well-known company with strong fundamentals. The fact that hedge funds are 50% short indicates to me that they believe the stock is overvalued and due for a correction. However, I believe the recent news of their poison pill defense against takeover attempts by third parties actually makes the stock more attractive as an investment at this time. With 140 million shares outstanding and only 270 million traded in the past 5 days, there appears to be significant potential for price appreciation in the near future.
2023-02-01;Haha the bubble is that anyone could make money in the market the past 10 years (stocks or real estate) and now that we are getting a re-pricing of everything and debt isn‚Äôt free, people that weren‚Äôt good but made money in the bull market now are not making money.

2023-02-01;If inflation comes in higher next time, there is no way for the fed to hike them back up to 50 bps next time without causing some major damage to the markets.   The 25 bps probably means that they are totally convinced that inflation will continue down, if they weren't convinced of this it would make a lot more sense to overshoot this month and lower the next, instead of the other way around.

Yeah he's been full of shit with a lot of his catch phrases, you're totally right there.   but when it comes to his rate hike forecasts, he has left no room for interpretation there and has been as clear as can be.

2023-02-01;I wouldn't say they raise the price artificially. They buy a house and fix it, which will increase the price of the house. Its a really valuable part of the housing economy especially in areas with aging housing infrastructure.
2023-02-01;The funniest thing about this market is when your response is actually the market that dictates fed policy, the market forced jpow into a pivot and he is now their bitch. If they say 25bps then that's what he will do

2023-02-01;Any average sized home (~1,500 sq ft) around here is going to go for a little under that. If you wanted something under $400k you're going to be in a 900 sq ft shitbox with foundation issues. And these prices were bad before interest rates rose. Now those houses are almost double the cost after factoring that in. Certainly don't envy any first time homebuyers right now.

2023-02-01;Do we feel bad for bears?
2023-02-01;Exactly
2023-02-01;Yeah there were just talking about a conservative expected / normal / historical average returns being ~3%. You are right though, the actual return would have been much higher. They couldn‚Äôt have known that though so had to make the decision using best guesses.

2023-02-01;The value of the home is very dependant on where it is. You can find an X sq ft home in one neighborhood that is 400k and the same sq ft home in a different neighborhood for 50k less. The age of the home is a factor, the size of the property is a factor, the neighborhood itself makes a difference. I moved from a high value part of the country to a much lower value part of the country and was able to get twice the size home for what I sold my townhouse for. So yes while the value of all homes generally rise over time, it is not an even distribution. Some areas go nuts, like say in California around Cupertino but places like Georgia and Alabama do not rise as quickly.   If you have a job that let's you work from home then your options become even more flexible.
2023-02-01;This entire market is a joke lol.   SPY is more volatile than BTC.

2023-02-01;[removed]
2023-02-01;Woah
2023-02-01;It has speculative value. Arguably no fundamental value.  If you could no longer trade Apple stocks, Apple stocks still have value because of dividends. It will retain most of it's fair value minus speculative value.   If you could no longer trade bitcoin, it will lose all of it's speculative value and retain it's fair value which is terrible considering bitcoin is 90% speculative value and 10% fair value. 10% is generous considering how many people use bitcoin for real utility like money transfers. Even it's nature as a hedge against inflation is speculative at best.  Do tell me why you bought bitcoin. Is it not to get rich from other people paying for it? Then your goal is speculative value.
2023-02-01;Holy shit alls I did NOT think you 410s were serious.

2023-02-01;I went down 5k to up 5k in 46 mins
2023-02-01;Different root causing, also different situation.  Inflation is up big time, investors own more of the RE market than ever before, ownership is mainly by the wealthy, RE loans delinquency still hasn't risen (2006 is rose and sky rockets out of 2007 into 2010.  There is so much money out there now due to printing that the wealthy have more money then ever before, by a long shot.  They may have enough juice to prop the market and avoid collapse.  We will see what happens though.  But I do think a collapse in RE won't be the same as before in terms of beta.  But 2007? I don't think so.  A lot is different now compared to any crash/recession/depression in the past.  Not saying we won't see a crash, but things would be worse now imo.  idk im not a Pelosi so idk the future

2023-02-01;No they will lose not gain. If four people are sharing netflix or trading netflix for some other streaming platform its because they cant afford the full price or dont think its worth the full price.   Sure there will be ones like my family where they pay everything and share but in that case they would keep it im not paying money for netflix I hardly watch it as is.   If my YouTube TV they find out we are sharing and try to make me pay 80 no ill just go get cable or do something like use my digital attena

Every person I've ever met that lives there has AT MOST been able to give me 2 suggestions for things they like to do for fun. It is so sad growing up in the south and hearing about it then actually going to see it and just being let down. Memphis blows and I could talk about it for hours.

2023-02-01;Well, the issue is that the system is connected.

I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.  That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies.

2023-02-01;Carvana..125% of the shares outstanding are owned by institutions. Hedge funds are 50% short. No float=naked shorts out there. Been watching since $7.18. Shares outstanding 140 million. Shares traded last 5 days 270 million. Do the math. Not a pump and dump. All info can be verified online. This is a well-known company with new fundamental news (poison pill). I bought just now at $12.03. I was on Wall street for 30 years. Looking to sell north of $30 and not before.

2023-02-01;I dont think so, while the market is overheated like 2007, the "special sauce" that really set up the great recession was the mortgage backed securities were being treated as if they were  bullet proof, and a whole house of cards was built on top of them.  This is what created the "systemic risk."  Even if a couple of regional bubbles burst it is much less likely to cause contagion.

2023-02-01;Fed is the most corrupt institution in the world‚Ä¶ there is a reason why other countries no longer want to base off of USD
2023-02-01;I know, my point was that even hypothetically "Meeting all demand" is not what post scarcity means...  &gt; In economics, scarcity "refers to the basic fact of life that there exists only a finite amount of human and nonhuman resources which the best technical knowledge is capable of using to produce only limited maximum amounts of each economic good."  ^ you cannot make infinite houses for zero resources, so they are a scarce asset

Which slows the economy, as capital rests in safes and pillowcases. A small amount of inflation is beneficial to avoid hoarding.

2023-02-01;Tell fed Powell that private real estate markets upped the ante on home prices so much so, even those in govenrment' want the value any home built is automatically worth on the private real estate market.    If a house is built using $25,000 worth of materials, the house usually sells for let's say double that.  Now add the private realty market, and go ahead and call it a half a million dollar real estate.  Plus if it's got a view it's worth even more, specially if it's got good weather, close to schools and public transit.  Why is the private real estate market, the driving factor?  Because appraisers often go with the value of what other homes in the area are selling for.    But, what happened to paying taxes on the actual value of the homes?    Something's more then wrong with the folks we've elected into government.  And not one person has been willing to uphold anything these.career politicians have enacted.  And someone should remove them and install new security for a free state, as per the constitution is written.  It's almost the only plan of action to take.  Plus the bought of the Rothschild's federal reserve which equivocates that for every dollar the market extends higher, the more every product costs, as a means of keeping order.  And that needs to go too.  There are lots of dollars being made, but it's all been going to roughly five people.  Musk, bezos, Zuckerberg, Blackstone, career politicians.

2023-02-01;but I dont see a reason why people are going to start "defaulting like crazy," even if there is a correction in a particularly hot market those people will still stay in their houses hoping to recoup their losses.  While they may be under-water currently they arent going to foreclose unless we see unemployment shoot up.  so far so good on that front.  the dominoes just aren't set up like they were last time around.  Not saying it couldnt happen, but I think it would require another shock to come from somewhere.

New white kitchen cabinets and countertops, new cheap laminate floors, fresh gray paint and ask double (or more) than what they payed.

2023-02-01;The reality is we have Not had a economic recovery since 2008.  Year 2008 was the year when we have reach peak participation rate for employment due to aging demographics population in all Western Development countries Not just in the US üá∫üá∏.  Ever since the FED had deficit spending from all of the QE programs and inflate all asset prices including houses.  However, there has Not been any real growth from the main Street economy since 2008.  It has all been inflated in prices by all of the QE programs.  This is the reality.

2023-02-01;I‚Äôm not saying there isn‚Äôt going to be a deep recession. What I was trying to say is I think the fed isn‚Äôt as worried about inflation as they they claim. I think they see that the economy is already slowing and know they won‚Äôt need to raise rates as much as they first thought. They will continue to talk tough, though, because coming out and saying we the terminal rate is going to be lower than expected is counter productive to their goals.
2023-02-01;Ok, but that's not the problem most people have.   When I was house shopping I was approved for $180k, and never saw a duplex less than like, $250k.  "I'll rent it out" isn't gonna convince the bank to give me more money.

2023-02-01;Absolutely detached reddit hive mindset. They will not lose subscribers, in fact, they will gain subscribers.   Netflix was testing this in other countries, and they would never launch it if it meant they would lose subscribers. Netflix Q1 calls YOLO is actually a great play.   With that being said, the end goal of streaming is unclear. Netflix does not have much growth prospects and once they squeeze more money out of subscribers using this they will be back to zero.

2023-02-01;Are you personally responsible for the notes? In some states you are not. The only recourse the Bank has is the property through their mortgage. If not you can default and let the bank foreclose. Of course you will never do business with that Bank again. If you are personally liable you maybe to push through a personal bankruptcy as well. This is a nuclear option though. You blow up your personal Balance Sheet and start all over again. Next time form an LLC to hold the property with no personal guaranty.

2023-02-01;&gt;The Federal Reserve's decision to downshift interest rates by 0.25% is a clear sign that the central bank is concerned about inflationary pressures in the economy. The Fed has been slowly tightening monetary policy over the past year, but with inflation still below its 2% target, it appears that further rate hikes may be on hold for now. This could provide some relief for borrowers who have been struggling to keep up with rising interest payments.

2023-02-01;*All* these house flippers are looking for a quick, big money payday by putting in low money 'upgrades' and charging a fortune.

It's numerous houses affected, so that provides precedence on pricing over all.   And you'll *never* see moderately updated houses for a moderate price.

2023-02-01;yes the market is cooling, and may be a bit more of a correction, but the bottom wont drop out like it did in 2008.  There are several reasons, the biggest of which is because we have  a housing shortage.  There are so many people on the sidelines waiting for the chance at a house as soon as the market starts to drop people come into the market and off of the sidelines as soon as they can afford it which creates a floor for the market.  Two other factors make this different from 2008, one is that mortgage companies have not been nearly as reckless in who they lend to over the past decade and a much smaller proportion of the loans are crazy flipper loans with giant ballooning payments.

2023-02-01;What? The entire reason Utah, Arizona, Nevada, Idaho and all these places doubled in value is because people from areas like NYC and LA were supposedly all trying to move here.   Also I know for a fact the NYC market hasn't gone up even a fraction as much as other areas. So you just don't follow the market and have no idea what is going on outside of one area that hasn't moved much in price.

2023-02-01;I think if you're young, you still want to get your money into equities now, as over time you will get a return of greater than 5%.  Also, bear in mind, rates WILL get cut. Whether it is 2023, or 2024, it will happen. And at that point, that risk-free 5% goes back to a risk-free 0.5%, and and you will have likely missed out on buying stocks at these lower levels.

2023-02-01;That's because the FOMC is a bunch of idiots who have no idea what they're doing.

2023-02-01;that has been priced in for a month now... when we "mooned" from 375-408...
2023-02-01;People have said this exact thing every hike for the last year.   Jpow has been incredibly consistent with his rhetoric and proved markets wrong every time by being true to his word. If he says two more hikes are coming, why after all this time do people still disagree with him?
2023-02-01;Also there's a massive decline in Blue Collar work because it was demonized so much in the 1990s. A lot of that can't be automated no matter what you do. Carpenters are becoming a thing of the past. What might fix that is manufactured/ modular housing will become the norm as you can do an assembly line to build pieces of houses and just have to have somebody who knows how to use a nail gun to smack it all together on a cement slab somewhere else. But things like Plumbing electrical are a little harder to automate, power plant workers, railroad workers, utility workers, and other very dangerous highly skilled trades. All trades that are experiencing shortages right now because few people under the age of 40 want to actually work in those fields, and even less that are actually skilled enough to do it. Coupled with brain drain because thanks to the pandemic many of these people retired out because the companies were too cheap to continue paying their senior workers during the pandemic even though the pandemic did not affect them as much. I personally witnessed this with one of my clients they offered their highest paid people retirement and now they're having brain drain problems and could not find anybody to replace them which started a Cascade of people quitting. The Railroad Strike is because of this as well. Where the railroad companies have retired out their senior workers, laid off a bunch of people and the people who remained are being overworked. With our government backing the railroad companies because they both know if they don't force the workers to endure the shitty conditions there will be no one left which can cause the economy to come to a grinding halt. Fun fact they're still not hiring new people and abusing the current workers, the union is not doing shit to help them either. One of my buddies just quit to work at an intermodal company for about the same pay with more benefits and less work. He was a rail worker for 15 years.

2023-02-01;Half of the report is trying to cover the science, with an entire page dedicated to describing a western blot (which is a very basic experimental technique).  Then the other half is complaining that the stock must be going down because of a shorting campaign.  And while I commend going at it from a different angle, the role of filamen-a in alzheimer's is not as strongly established as this report makes it seem.    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simufilam  In fact, looking at the history of this drug is pretty discouraging.  Papers establishing the FLNA were published in PLoS One, which is fairly easy to get published in as is, but then was retracted. The early papers specifically for the drug were not retracted, but the journals that published them put out statements of concern about their findings.  Additionally, the group behind it has garnered a lot of suspicion of research fraud, which seems pretty well founded based on what I'm reading. Like having their results re-anlayzed by an "outside lab" that was actually associated with the group.  I work in Alzheimer's disease getting my PhD.  I'm sitting in a lab wasting some time between experiments.  So I'm no expert, but if anyone has some questions maybe I can help field them.  I literally never heard of FLNA in Alzheimer's disease before this post, and the whole thing stinks (in my humble opinion).
2023-02-01;But his plays are not inifinite capital based. So no he isnt shorting everyday lol

2023-02-01;This. Paid $5k on 400k townhouse for first home. We had an extra percentage of interest as a trade-off but were able to refinance after a few years and got out from the PMI. Sold during the boom late 2021 and moved to a cheaper state, and bought a house double the size of my townhouse with the proceeds of the sale. My mortgage is slightly less than my first one, and the payments are less as well.  It's possible to own your own home. Your first purchase may not be your dream home, but the equity that you pay into it coupled with the increase in value over time will help get you to the home you've always wanted.

2023-02-01;With thousands of homes bought by companies and foreign investors sitting empty, an argument can be made that the scarcity is artificial. One would need to define owned but empty houses differently as compared to residences that are inhabited, but that seems like a sensible distinction. Honestly, homes that are used as investments rather than domiciles should have vastly different taxes applied to them and that might help free up homes for those that do not own and are effectively priced out of the market for buying a home.

Depends on if his current contractor is going to take 14 months to flip a house again. If he has the contacts (wholesalers) to pass him more deals if he has the cash, there could be an opportunity that selling the house gives him that renting does not.

2023-02-01;It doesnt necessarily have to involve over leveraging though many times can. Also most of the gain comes from the refinance part where you use the rents as cash flow to inflate the value of the house and then use that money to buy more properties.    Also you gain from using an llc or some business to shield your income so you get taxed less and do stuff like depreciate the house against the income your making.

2023-02-01;Sigh.  Nominal debt (and it's not that much higher).  What are the ratios? What are the delinquencies? Bankruptcies? Foreclosures? What's the job market like, what's borrowing capacity like, what are the credit scores of the borrowers? What % is subprime? What % are ARMs? What rates are households locked in at?  Delinquencies of all debt are below 2008 by a country mile. It's not even close.  Bankruptcies and foreclosures are 80-90% less than 2008. They are at least 50% less than 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007.  The quality of borrower today is far superior to the 2000s. There is less subprime. There is less ARMs. Large portions of borrowers have debt riding 3% ultra low interest.  There is no comparison at all. Households are employed, have tons of borrowing capacity, their balance, income sheets are in the best shape in decades.

2023-02-01;The only reason I disagree is bc it seems like mortgage-backed securities aren‚Äôt as popular as they were then, and the # of subprime mortgages isn‚Äôt nearly as high. Plus, ppl are ‚Äòstuck‚Äô with house sub-3 or 4 percent interest. And it‚Äôs constant, not ballooning. House prices are falling, and will fall, due to a shortage of new homes (builders don‚Äôt want o be left holding the bag again like 08) and a huge increase in demand. It‚Äôs hard to willingly buy a house at 6.5 % when you could‚Äôve got one for like 2.75 a year ago. Doesn‚Äôt feel fair and this will keep people out of the market more than anything else. If a ‚Äòbursting bubble‚Äô happens, feds will lower rates to combat it. The biggest issue with US housing currently is the gap between wages and mortgage payments. People simply don‚Äôt make enough to reasonably afford houses in most major cities.

Also, the idea that minority working class families getting priced out of their neighborhoods through gentrification is wildly racist as is the idea that minority families don't welcome gentrification. No one wants to raise a family in an area full of abandoned buildings/houses because people and businesses DO NOT want to be there.   In short, grow up you short sighted SJ warrior.

2023-02-01;The FOMC is clearly indicating that they intend to keep interest rates relatively high in order to combat inflationary pressures. This will likely lead to a sell-off in the stock market as investors become concerned about the impact of higher borrowing costs on corporate profits.

2023-02-01;I was just on chat with support for over 30 minutes asking them how an account for a divorced family will work. They couldn't answer me.  My daughter spends half their time at my house and half their time at my ex' house. She has a TV in each of her rooms at our separate households. From what's been presented, my daughter's TV at my ex' house will be blocked after x number of days.  I'm paying $21 and change (including tax) for 4 screens. I'm not going to continue paying MORE than HBO Max/Disney+/Hulu/Paramount Plus/Peacock charge if they demand more for my kid to have their own account.

2023-02-01;&gt;	The think you have failed to understand over and over again is that Jpow is in no was responsible for the financial markets. So even if someone told you the bond market is pricing in 25bps, that shouldn‚Äôt impact the FED decision one bit.  Absolutely.  At least you‚Äôre finally realizing the original thing I was trying to convey to you, that 25bp *is in fact priced in*.  Can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre just back peddling, or legitimately too stupid to tell the different between what you‚Äôre saying now, and what you said yesterday.

2023-02-01;What do you think they're pushing open borders and immigrants from vastly poorer countries? It's not because they take pity on people, they know they're doing irreparable damage, they don't want homeowners they want servants and slaves, and they want the immigrants to be the new servant class. Minorities are more visibly different and easier to make a caste system when you have people that look visibly different than those who run things. They already accounted for this long ago. They want to make sure there's a group of people who will not be able to intrude in their domain. They've been playing this game since before we were born. There was a time when being the wrong kind of white was enough to keep you from moving up in society, but enough people didn't give a fuck that soon all the white people were mixed up with other white people. All they did is change strategies of trying to suppress the lower classes. Which is also going to backfire on them because there's a lot of Latino and black entrepreneurs popping up despite their best efforts.

2023-02-01;Anything happening right now is sporadic maurkitism. The real action comes when Jacob Pow Pow speaketh. Hold on to your disillusionment and best of luck regards
2023-02-01;JPOW talking could make this moon ridiculously hard imo. If he talks himself up saying soft landing in sight etc.  Anyway, keeping my position as I only bought 3 OTM QQQ puts so if I lose my $300 fuck it.
2023-02-01;How I played this:     SPXU calls (same as SPY puts) and AMD calls/call spreads.   AMD plays with the NASDAQ, and after earnings there's still a positive bullish structure and story, and IV crushed this morning. If the market declines, AMD will likely outperform in a positive direction because of fundamentals positioning and algorithmic trading conflict, meanwhile IV crush from earnings made AMD option spreads cheap relative to index options.

2023-02-01;Just make the service free. Stuff it with commercials and ad content with links to buy:  movie merchandise, branded studios tshirts, hats, surround sound home viewing systems, vintage movie posters, season passes to AMC for $199.00, etc.  Customers who don't want these interruptions can pay the flat rate fee for an annual subscription similar to what YouTube offers.  Netflix needs to understand how technology will be commoditized over time.  So they need to pivot and create new streams of cashflow (in the physical world).  The data capture from customers alone could at billions in future sales capabilities.  Of course....they will have go to work and create new sales systems. Vanity movie projects with over paid actors unfortunately will have to go.

2023-02-01;I looked into doing this in 2020 before the housing market exploded and in hindsight I would have made a lot but that‚Äôs tough to predict. What‚Äôs not tough to predict was the expected returns which were 3% a year in housing appreciation (LOL) and around 8% in rental fees from Air B&amp;B - expected cost to maintain. So I was looking at around 11% returns which was tough to justify given how much work it‚Äôd all be when the stock market gives me close to 10.

2023-02-01;It's a little more involved. You buy a distressed property that you can't get a mortgage on. It could be too fucked up to pass inspection or it might have someone living in it preventing you or an inspector from going inside.   Because of the risk and the fact that they can't be financed by a traditional mortgage, distressed properties like that are sold at a substantial discount.   Then once the property is fixed or the tenant is kicked out they will rent it out. Once its generating cashflow they can get financing on favorable terms and use that cash to repeat the cycle on a new property.   It's high risk, high reward.

2023-02-01;I like the misinformation that intel are faster.   Currently they're a bit faster at gaming but the 3D chips will wipe the floor with them.   And where multicore performance matters to the point price doesn't because more cores pays they simply won't have an answer or come remotely close to threadripper. And they get smacked in the data centre.   The only use case for intel is multicore performance on the cheap for none professional work.

2023-02-01;The other "secret" to flipping is that you make all the money on the flip when you buy the house. It HAS to be something you can make money off immediately to another investor. The rehab portion is profitable, but most of that profit is eaten up by the contractor.  I agree with you holistically, but the world is big enough for caveats regardless of the market.   There's always a person you can buy a house from that doesn't want to show the inside to everybody with a Realtor. Usually a situation where like a parent is slowly dying in the house. Saw it dozens of times when I flipped houses for \~2 years. While you can inform the owner that they will absolutely get more money if they put their house on the market, it can be less stressful for them to just sell it to an investor.  There's also the even more unethical situations where its someone who wants cash quickly (the most icky feeling was the drug/gambling addicts), or you are buying from a wholesaler who somehow got an insane price reduction due to what I can only consider a type of social engineering/confidence scam that I never understood.

2023-02-01;&gt;Oh, I see. Well then you‚Äôve just changed from what you originally said then.  That's not it. You probably need to read more than three words to understand my point but I think you could read allvyhe words and still not understand.   &gt;Your new position is at least rational  You saying so actually makes me a little nervous because you haven't said anything rational all day.   The think you have failed to understand over and over again is that Jpow is in no was responsible for the financial markets.  So even if someone told you the bond market is pricing in 25bps, that shouldn't impact the FED decision one bit.   25bps would risk making things worse, and even if that might be nice for the stock market in the very short term, it would likely make things worse further down the line.

2023-02-01;&gt; This is true, but I would argue that the first 50 basis points are the most important. If we can't feel them, then what's the point?
2023-02-01;Yeah, I've definitely done that before. Then thinking I've learned my lesson, I over held the wrong move.  Now I realize its a gamble and that's it.
2023-02-01;what if JPOW just says ".25% percent? you mis heard me, 25% hike. 30% interest rates bitches"
2023-02-01;Only if the stock remains the same.

2023-02-01;It becomes a business/a job right away. The returns are fairly high, but that's because you have to put in time and effort.. kind of like just regular ol salaried work.  Not a bad idea, but you can lose money if you just buy property and do nothing.. i.e. don't take care of it, be a good landlord and fix problems as they arise. Or be a proper host, for short term rentals, same idea.

2023-02-01;Well yeah, but wanting to succeed isn't related to whether it would actually happen.  Anyway I will stand by my previous speculation of earnings trend.  Even if earnings go flat, it will still miss estimates because people expected more this time around.  Though there's the possibility that market rallies for fed doing 25.  A minute ago I just got in with a small dose of 130P with 2 weeks.  At worst I lose 400 bucks.

2023-02-01;Okay. About 400k people bought homes (total) in 2021 and 2022 which represents the vast majority of the price inflation that now makes up our housing pricing.   This is out of a huge number of homes, and leaves out all the lucky people who bought in 20.   Therefore for these homes to suddenly have to be foreclosed: massive amounts of people (who for the majority bought wayyyy before 2019) have to lose their ability to pay the mortgage.   Sorry buddy. Pricing is here to say.

2023-02-01;Adding to this, first time homebuyers only need to put down 3% on conventional loans. While your rate will be higher it is an option.

People need to shop around and even if you don't have a better quote you can always try to pressure your lender into covering fees or applying a concession if you're looking around.

2023-02-01;He does a dance
2023-02-01;Powell walks up to the podium, does a 360 and announces negative rates.
2023-02-01;You don't need unemployment to skyrocket. Labor force participation is still below pre-covid levels, which is a big reason why unemployment is still low. But also you have to factor how much employment, and the type of employment. Avg hours work is trending down, which mean people are staying employed, but working less. And the industries doing a ton of layoffs are the highest paid, while the industries desperate to hire are the lowest paid.  Last year [140k jobs were cut in tech](https://news.crunchbase.com/startups/tech-layoffs/), and 58k so far this year. I'd venture to guess that those jobs are equivalent to anywhere between 2-5x the same number of service/food industry jobs. You gotta analyze deeper than just the headline numbers they feed the public.  Another factor is everyone's savings is now below pre-covid levels, while credit card debt is way higher, including the interest rate on that debt. So the current credit debt burden is significantly higher than it was pre-covid. People are quickly going broke because of the rapid inflation we had. Less savings and more credit debt mean people are less credit worthy for home loans, and have less to spend on discretionary spending. Economy is gunna slow like mad, and the doom lop will start to pick up speed.
2023-02-01;If inflation affects you, you have a problem üòÇ
2023-02-01;I also see the ultra bearish sentiment. So yea. I'm playing both sides. I have calls and puts. But you can't just assume bullish momentum will continue. You have many stocks up over 25% in past month and indices doing well too. Not all of this is good for main street or treasuries. We shall see in 10 min.

2023-02-01;Look into another area then? Some areas in 2007 did not see a correction at all. Where I‚Äôm at in Utah I‚Äôve easily seen a 20% decrease in prices since last summer. The bubble is going to burst in some areas, 100%.

2023-02-01;At this point in this market , nothing would surprise me
2023-02-01;Sure, and I'm not against it on paper, but I really doubt a lot of the people using it realize the dangerous house of cards they are building.   At scale, taking a little equity out of each property and using that to expand is totally reasonable. But leveraging every house up to its ears in debt and spending all that cash on the next project is risky as hell. And my guess is most of the people on Facebook are doing the latter, not the former.

2023-02-01;Means you have a margin of safety and find a deal when buying, not hoping that everything goes perfect for selling.   I have a couple rentals. I don‚Äôt buy anything where my purchase cost + repairs won‚Äôt be covered by rent and I include a margin of safety.   That‚Äôs why I haven‚Äôt bought one since early 2020.

2023-02-01;Pitfalls of the cannabis industry.   Oversupply: My local legal market is saturated with product. Brings the overall cost of the product down because all the retail entities compete with each other.   Shelf life: unless you are hermetically sealing the product. It has a relatively short shelf life. Especially when you process it into hash oil.  Demand: Demand isn't as high as people think it is. Just because it is legal doesn't mean everyone is going to do it. There will be several professions barred from using marijuana. And legalization isn't necessarily going to increase consumption in current stoners. Hardcore stoners have their smoking pattern and find a way to make it economical.   Trade: If and when we start international trade it will start becoming like most other agricultural commodities. We will also face competition from other countries. Canada and some other countries may be able to compete in terms of quality. We will never compete with the likes of India, Thailand &amp; Mexico in terms of price. Labor is cheap and the stuff already grows in the wild there. The stuff will never be sold as is. It'll be extracted. From an extractors perspective.... It's better to pay $100 a pound for weed that yields 6% oil rather than $1300 (current avg us market rate for pound) for a pound that yields 10%.   Profitability: most commercial operations have a profitability issue. When you add in wages, regulatory fees, insurance, building costs, commercial electricity and water rates this venture becomes very expensive.  Just off the top of my head. I'm not an analyst but I've been involved in cannabis industry since early 2000's.

If I were to jump now, even though the market has dipped a little, I'd lock in a sweet 6% interest rate even with immaculate credit, which would mean damn-near doubling my mortgage payment for whatever I'm upgrading to, even if the cost of the new thing dropped below what I still owe on the current thing.

2023-02-01;Agree in general and again its regional, we saw softening in the market end of 2022, but 2023 has picked up again and people are paying up a bit from what they were paying late last year as there just isn't inventory...housing is always supply/demand driven..and in areas that continue to grow, there is no bubble, in areas where people moved to because they could "work from home"...and now are being told to get back to the office.. those areas may have some serious hurt coming.

I have lost money b/c I forgot about a position and didn't pay attention to it. Today I have 2k riding on FOMC being bad. If I lose it, literally nothing about my mood or life changes.

2023-02-01;It is true that rising stock prices can hurt the fight against inflation, but it is also true that the Fed has been quite clear about its intentions to keep rates low for an extended period of time. Inflationary pressure is only one factor among many that the Fed must consider when setting monetary policy, so I do not believe that JPow's comments should be taken as a sign that the central bank will turn more hawkish in the near future.

2023-02-01;Millenial here as well.  Started out my adult life in the hole because my parents did not pay back a loan I made them as an 18 year-old with my first credit card.  Had a brother whose family was going to get thrown out of their home. Loaned him 4k he never gave back.  Went to and graduated college.  That cost 20k.  I've been lucky with my job, my self-employment as an artist, and in my investing and I've been able to pay off my student loans.  BUT, we live in a country where at least 40,000,000 people can't afford a sudden $400 expense, and that's not because of anything they did. It's because our elected leaders are corrupt, getting rich themselves (they can loan their campaigns money at 20% interest legally and pay themselves back with campaign funds), and have made it possible to operate a major corporation in this country and pay zero taxes. The federal minimum wage has been stuck at 7 measly bucks for almost 15 years, so you can't even work your way out of poverty in many places.   Maybe you do own your own home, but I'd wager you're luckier than you're willing to admit. This country makes it extremely difficult to grow up poor and succeed.

2023-02-01;Builders are not building, inventory is down, and with interest rates high new old inventory is no-where to be found.

2023-02-01;I think the idea is if you buy a house ‚Äúworth‚Äù 1 million for 800k then you make the 200k when you buy it. The implication being it‚Äôll be worth 1 million eventually when you sell it via appreciation. Sorta doesn‚Äôt work the more you think about appreciation of time, the area, or renovations.  Another way to think about it is the price you buy the house for never changes, so you better make sure that is the right price.

2023-02-01;Well yea, obviously they aren't going to file an 10k that says Musk is locked in his shared for 2 years.  He loaned money using his Tesla shares as collateral.   So if he can't pay the interest on the loan, his shares will always get sold to raise money to make the payments.   What it probably means is that he isn't intending to sell for taxes or other stuff.   If you are a Teslatard and you only want it because Elon is hodling, that's probably a weird investment strategy.

Sticker price of a house is not, but that's because it isn't a "cost oof iving" any more than the price of a stock share is: you're paying yourself and get to cash out later.  It does include all actual costs though such as rent, mortgage interest, maintenance, furnite, utilities, insurance...

2023-02-01;This right here. The disintegration of the world‚Äôs healthcare systems is a prime example of what life will be like in the future. No one physically able to work and only 1% who can actually participate in the economy.   Eventually the less and less ppl who are able to work or afford to participate in the economy will lead to a economic dry-up. This is a (self-coined) term that describes an economy that is purely run by the 1%. E.g. only the 1% are spending money and only the 1% are making money. It‚Äôs the result of a long term bottlenecking of resources by a small group within a large population. This leads to mass death as well as social unrest within 99% of the population. Eventually wealth is forced to be redistributed through death or conquest.   And as for automation- Automation requires regular maintenance of the machines and computers. That maintenance can only be done by humans.   As for slavery- Good luck to anyone who thinks 1% of the population can actually enslave 99% of the population. Yea, it‚Äôs easy to oppress 99% of the population, but once that 99% has had enough the 1% is easily killed off.

2023-02-01;I am a Realtor and let me tell you there were many questionable purchases being done by people in 2020 to 2022. I won't name which city this happened and which street this is, but let me share what happened.      In 2021 I had a client who wanted to see this house for sale. This house is located in a terrible neighborhood where it is predominately being run by a gang. It has a high crime rate, public drunkenness is quite common, and there were innocent people who got killed there in the past 2 years. One victim was this girl who was only visiting her friend got shot in her car simply because the gang members didn't recognize her. The residents there will likely approach and hurt you should they not recognize you. They did that to me when I was in the area at night when I went to meet up with a friend.      It was broad daylight and my client met up with me at the property. As soon as she stepped out of the car, she looked around the neighborhood and said she doesn't want to see the property anymore because she didn't feel safe. I was completely understanding and told her we don't have to see it if she doesn't feel safe.     A week later that same home was sold above asking for more than a $1 million dollars. This home is relatively average with only 3 bedrooms and with a pool. The person who bought it likely thought of doing short term rentals, but in my experience this house will have a hard time finding people who are willing to rent there for short term due to how sketchy the area is. I bet you the residents nearby would trash the place whenever its unoccupied. Should the buyer plan to stay there long term they will sell it far beyond what they paid for upon realizing how dangerous that neighborhood is.

2023-02-01;and unlike 2006, strippers‚Ä¶‚Ä¶errrrrrrr, I mean independent contractors were not buying a home let alone multiple homes using stated income these past few years.  people buying homes to live in as their primary residence had to show verifiable W2 income along with actual down payments above 3.5% FHA minimums.    so‚Ä¶.yeah‚Ä¶..not all bubbles are created equally nor do they deflate equally.  This ‚Äúinvestor‚Äù sounds like a jackoff.  ‚Äúcontractor theft‚Äù my ass.  They probably went with a super shady contractor just to save some money.

2023-02-01;No catalyst I can see for a major pop in nat gas prices anytime until next winter and even then‚Ä¶ not a sure thing.  How‚Äôd we get here?  During/after COVID oil and gas production plummeted due to demand destruction. Once we reopened everything after COVID there was a demand surge, but production has caught up to it and more so.    There is basically no such thing domestically as a pure gas well, all nat gas production comes as byproduct of targeting oil wells.  Drilling, fracing, etc has ramped up enormously since then.  Oil companies are ran much better now and have very low break even prices for oil.  Production won‚Äôt take a meaningful hit until prices drop below 40$ (unlikely).  That means excess nat gas is the new normal.  Add in a likely global recession and the demand side of nat has equation is not ideal either.  Freeport can only move 2% of US production daily.  Not going to be meaningful long term.   Warmer winters likely moving forward (ironic eh)‚Ä¶  I knew all of these facts and still tried to catch the falling knife because I was thinking I could catch a bounce.  Bounce might not come.  Nat gas could easily go below 2$ and stay there for years making boil dead money.

2023-02-01;&gt; i'm skeptical he was saying those products actually did anything for covid.  He did pretty much say this though. If he was trying to push it as an investment, he was doing it indirectly by advocating for its use. I just don't think that would really make sense if it's not a novel, patented drug that would have potentially made a pharma stock skyrocket.  That being said, I also don't think he loses any credibility for believing it might be a treatment. He said this stuff in March 2020. It's easy to say it doesn't work in hindsight, but at the time it wasn't so clear. The FDA even issued an emergency use authorization. I can't find any information on how his view on the matter has evolved though, so disregard this last paragraph if he still believes in it.

2023-02-01;As a contractor, flipper and landlord. There are several issues. In Tn it is common to force a contractor to begin work and only get paid as a job is complete. Usually it‚Äôs 50% on rough in and 40% on final with 10% held for the next project or incidentals.   In this case it sounds like the contractor did the work and was paid but didn‚Äôt finish and no inspection was done. This happens a lot in Memphis. People come in form out of state and get a contractor to let you work under his license. I have been with MLGW when we went door to door catching these guys in the act of selling their license. In one day we shut down 200 homes that were being flipped and not one had the proper permit or license holders name for the permits pulled.   What I would do at this point is Airbnb the property for now. Your kinda stuck unless you want to take a massive hit. The housing market is already falling it‚Äôs just jot showing in a lot of areas. In Nashville we have houses that are sitting empty due to the fact they know they will flood the market if they list them.   The other option is yes sell and take a loss and move on. We all make mistakes and have to lick wounds. I have been forced to move into a house I was flipping just to keep from a loss and then sell my current home as it more profitable at the time.   It is very hard to prosecute contractors without a contract. Basically it‚Äôs small claims and you have to prove a lot of steps.   I would be willing to talk with you and see if you want to sell at cost but I can tell you the market is already off 20% from peak. I have four rentals and right now all of them are down from the high last year in august.

2023-02-01;While we may be "in 2007"... the housing market will likely not lead the recession, if it happens (e.g. a 2008 like financial collapse) it will be due to inflationary issues.    If you look into the purposes behind the crash, it will due to loans being given to LITERAL anyone who asked and had a job making over 20,000 a year.  Now, getting a loan for a home is not nearly as easy.  You actually need to cover the loan.  Some small banks allow loans IF you have the funds and no jobs, but you have to prove you have the funds.  No big bank is giving out a loan to anyone without the ability to cover it

2023-02-01;&gt;I believe that there is a strong possibility that one of the big two soda companies will acquire Prime in the near future. The brand has seen significant growth in popularity, especially among younger consumers, and I think this trend will continue. Coca-Cola and Pepsi are both solid brands with a lot of potential, so I think either could be a good choice for an acquisition.
2023-02-01;Correct. even during the great recession of the 2000s the housing market in my area was not really impacted that severely.
2023-02-01;Not even if he works at the FED Atlanta?
2023-02-01;&gt;Here are some ideas:  1. CNBC hosts/analysts - e.g. Jim Cramer, Joe Kernen, Becky Quick 2. Keywords related to specific stocks/companies that have been in the news recently - e.g. Tesla, Amazon, Facebook 3."Technical analysis" terms like "support and resistance", "trend lines", etc.

2023-02-01;As much as I'd enjoy seeing a 50 bps (and think it's a necessary step toward dispelling the idea of the fed "put") -- the most likely scenario (in my mind) is 25 bps + some hawkish commentary in light of the still-rosy macro picture and rally in shit tier stocks/crypto in Jan.

2023-02-01; I have limited experience with buy and hold real estate.  I don‚Äôt flip. Example- I bought a house in Charlotte in 2007 for 83k.  I rented it out.  Yes, I benefited from the tax write offs and appreciation,  but at that price, it took me years to be comfortably cash flow positive.  Additionally, I had to replace a roof, water heater, heat pump, appliances, windows, sills, siding, bathrooms and had evictions.  This is just normal wear and tear.  At the prices these investors were snatching up homes last year, MAYBE the rent will cover their investment but what will happen when these large improvements come up? I sold my personal Socal house to an investor sight unseen and I don‚Äôt even see how they can cover a note with rent.  When these expenses are due, are we going to see a wave or foreclosures? I don‚Äôt see how we won‚Äôt.

2023-02-01;I suggest buying in tranches and use the long term chart as a point of reference.  i would initiate a starter position and add on weakness.   &amp;#x200B;  who knows but that today's 6.31 scratch might be the low for the year, but ,if not i would love to add a little more any cheaper .  &amp;#x200B;  I remember suggesting to the BOIL longs to sell at 123.oo and they would not listen .  &amp;#x200B;  Its dejavu but now the risk has inverted and favors buyers of Natural gas at sub 2.60   &amp;#x200B;  When the sell off starts on KOLD , it will be swift and painful for those who bought today at 62.75 area
2023-02-01;Max pain is sideways. Market trades sideways for two weeks then dump! Change my mind
2023-02-01;It's so funny that we pay so much attention to companies like Meta and their earnings, which comes from stealing attention from us and making us watch stupid 30 second videos and scroll on their app like monkeys.

2023-02-01;No problem glad i could help. also Ive heard of how the market works but never used it. If this is something that youre interested in and want to do more of then its not a bad place to start getting some preliminary info and exposure to the market. as far as the assignments and grades, im assuming they want you to be focused more on longer term trades and investments? if so then it might help to look at large cap stocks that have proven trends over years of being traded. these stocks also tend to have more "predictable" trends and reactions to catalysts and market conditions, with less irrational movements. another thing you can look at is how some stocks mirror the movements of other stocks or of the SPY, as well as some futures having inverse relationships with eachother (essentially one moves up and the other moves down). of course these anomalies arent a guarantee of a successful trade, but it can help give you things to look at when deciding where to put your money.

TLDR; stock go down you make money, but as time goes on you also lose money so if stock move down slowly with time, no money is made or you lose money, stock go up, you lose money fast  Id really urge you to use YouTube and Investopedia to learn how options work along with never, ever bet money that you aren‚Äôt willing to lose. Id also recommend paper trading for at least a year with some sort of strategy and specific rules that you set in place to figure out if you‚Äôre comfortable with trading, but not many people listen to this. There‚Äôs a subreddit called thetagang that is really good for learning advanced options.

It's not even close.   It's also the quality of borrower and capacity of borrower. Vast swaths of people have refinanced down to 3% mortgages over the last 10 years, their credit scores are much higher than the people getting loans in 2004, 2005, 2006, their available access to credit is much higher.

It's almost like last week was the rally and we are trading sideways into the meeting. But the difference makes me feel like the meeting will trade a lot differently. But I can't fathom what after will look like. If any of this made sense lmao.

2023-02-01;It's because they are lying - as they should. If they show their hand it changes the market, so its a constant bluff. Just like they sounded pretty sure about 'transitory inflation', they sure sound pretty sure about 'higher for longer' too, don't they?  Bears saying 25 isn't enough are like people who think you shouldn't slow down the car until you're AT the stoplight; all the data points in the right direction, there gonna be a lot of clown-faced bears when all the sudden "higher for longer" is dropped off the speech - which on investing timeframes is inevitable.

2023-02-01;Your point is wrong bro, I've seen you post in other spaces about this. Are there businesses that function without "tech"? Sure, there are a few lingering businesses in every sector that are able to thrive running on an older framework.   A LARGE majority of every sector simply needs to leverage tech to be competitive. You might not see it, as the boots on the ground, but it's there. Be it analytics, design, social media, advertising platforms.   The idea that tech isn't important for small businesses is laughably ignorant. It would be just as ignorant to say "we don't really need skilled laborers, we can just bring in unskilled immigrants and teach them your job quickly, for less money!".

2023-02-01;Exactly. Layoffs are to discourage unionization, job hopping, and workers rights in general, but it won't work.   The layoffs are just media hype / postering. 80,000 laid off but 10,000,000 current job openings and lowest unemployment in 50 years.   Googles own user location data shows that time spent in offices is still down dramatically (43% in San Francisco And 28% in Los Angeles) and layoffs will not effect our determination to remain work-from-home.

2023-02-01;&gt; that would logically make sense.   I'm sure that makes sense to a regarded gambling addict.   &gt;To say that the market is not pricing for 25bps is just ridiculous and wrong.  What I said was something along the lines that anyone expecting, (like in "counting on") 25bps is regarded and after that you started throwing fits.   &gt;You‚Äôre saying that not only do you expect 50bps, but that the market is pricing for 50bps, right?  Nope that's not it.   I said I'm expecting a 50bps hike and that anyone expecting, (like in "counting on") 25bps is regarded.   Everything else is your own mental gymnastics to cope with the fact that you haven't got a clue what you're doing.  I think the main difference here is that you expect a 50bps to cause every single stock to fall below their 52 week lows and then continue down forever, while i think expecting that to happend is moronic beyond comprehension.

2023-02-01;Housing ‚Äúbubbles‚Äù save for the one in 07-08 which was caused by Wall St. are rarely if ever one size fits all. There are a lot of factors that determine values, and these factors are usually decided/determined at a local or maybe county level. For example, a city that just secured the transfer of a company, might see an injection of people looking for houses, thus seeing home properties appreciate or at the very least maintain. You just discovered that there is an underground mine fire encompassing the entire town - as was the case with Centralia, PA. Home prices are going to plummet. Usually towns with a big college or university are also relatively immune to market slowdowns. The correlation between the stock market and the housing market is not a 1-1, as most homeowners don‚Äôt necessarily own stock save for whatever is sitting on their 401(k). I don‚Äôt know the ins and outs of the Memphis housing market, but I am willing to say that that flipper is more than likely underwater moreso because of his own ineptitude than the market taking a hit.

2023-02-01;I'd say 2+ years. Production will not be at 100% utilization until Q4 2024. Cost/kg is also connected to the utilization rate so it will be hard to judge a fair price for the stock until real numbers come out. Alot can happen for the silicon price in that timeframe, which is what I see as the biggest risk.   But it should be a good buy none the less. ROI looks to be quite good.   The newly entered agreement have protection for both parties with a min./max. price per kg.  The Moses Lake facility bringing in a surplus of cash will also enlight the Butte, Montana facility as well. As of today the surplus made from Butte is/has been used to maintain the Moses Lake facility in case of a restart. Which is now finally happening!     They have a 110M USD loan thats due this year. But the advance payment from Hanwha might just cover this + upgrades necessary to start production next year.   In any case there are several ways to solve this loan. They have more opportunities now that the contract has been disclosed.
2023-02-01;Yeah but I would rather lose a lil money then a lot. Risk to reward is great
2023-02-01;Rent it Section 8 to the federal government.  They don‚Äôt miss payments and you could help out a needy family.

2023-02-01;My 395 ban bet is in jeopardy.
2023-02-01;Maybe you‚Äôre trading the wrong style, and it doesn‚Äôt match your personality. I HATE scalping and I finally realized it‚Äôs just not a good fit for my personality. So now I trade /ES in a systematic approach and its much less dramatic and stressful. The emotional attachment is still there, but it‚Äôs 10% of the intensity it used to be. Find your natural trading fit and life is much easier.

They could have made more profits if they shorted and released the report after the fpo was over but no. Retail investors would have lost big if hindenburg didn't short at the right time. They lost a bit of profit but saved several thousands of retail investors.

2023-02-01;I am a sound engineer and I have done blind tests before. there is a noticeable drop in quality from a lossless audio file to a compressed AAC file, particularly in the frequencies above 7.5kHz (generally speaking most adults can perceive sounds up to ~16kHz).  it's less noticeable at 320kbps but if you are listening critically you will hear a difference. at the lower quality settings ("low" is 24kbps and "normal" is 96kbps) the difference is readily apparent, and it also starts effecting the rest of the frequency spectrum as well.  but as I said in my original comment, most people who are not trained audio professionals will either not notice or not care about the difference in quality, which is good enough for the application.

2023-02-01;Yes you‚Äôre right but Bullard came out and said that the market is moronic a couple weeks ago and that they‚Äôre gonna feel pain. I have calls but I‚Äôd be wrong to say I‚Äôm not worried.
2023-02-01;It really doesent matter what you bet on as long as you got stop Loss
2023-02-01;Prices have been steadily decreasing in response to interest, and will continue going lower.  That's not a bubble, that's a steady, and very foreseeable decline.  A bubble would be everyone buying a house they can't afford and a ton of defaults/foreclosures causing a crash.    Right now it's really just the interest rates causing the price drops.  As this recession gets worse, then maybe we'll see foreclosures.  I hope not though.
2023-02-01;If it's trading slightly in your favor after 3pm, please don't risk it and close for a profit...I hope it tanks so you bank but it would be torture if it just traded flat and theta burns you

2023-02-01;Its like, analogously, investing in a 0% Interest savings account because you're afraid of the second coming of Jesus Christ disrupting the economy.  Adjusting for inflation, gold price is almost a tenth of what it was in 1980.  And much like Crypto, its monetary value drops as less people assign it arbitrary value.

2023-02-01;When I started in this (the 70's) this was pretty much standard fare.

2023-02-01;If you're worried about losing $700 - you don't make enough income.  Instead of trying to trade your $2,000 savings account. Work on a skill.. get really good at it.. and sell it at a higher cost.  When your income exceeds the need to worry about money.. which is sounds like losing $700 has tilted you... you won't stress as much.  Also, don't focus on the AMOUNT of money. Look at %. So if $500 was a 20% gain. THAT IS A GREAT GAIN. TAKE THE GREAT GAINS. Don't go for 1000x baggers all of the time.. it's a losing strategy.

If you're getting surprised or disappointed by the outcomes of your trades, then it's time to step away and reassess your approach. Maybe consider taking a break from trading altogether until you can get yourself in a better frame of mind.

2023-02-01;I went heavy on this one. I have been tracking for months. We bounced off the bottom and are in an uptrend. My TA has shows a retracement to test the 17.63 previous high. Today it broke through the prior resistance at  15.15. Once this level is claimed as support, there isn‚Äôt much resistance before testing 17.63. At 17.5 the options are worth 7.14x. With the FOMC news today, and earnings coming soon, I believe the upward trend will continue rapidly and we may even see 18.00.

2023-02-01;But Not with your credit
2023-02-01;Yes
2023-02-01;Here's the thing though - people have felt that way for every single generation. Every single market investor feels that way when market is down and there's global conflict.  1. Population is not declining, globally it is increasing. Yes, some countries have serious population replacement issues (Japan, South Korea etc). However those are solvable problems and we don't know what the future will look like. They may get their act together and really incentivize people to have kids instead of their weak promises. Immigration can also help. 2. Globalization drives profits, just in other markets. That's why you get international exposure, like VXUS. There have been periods of time where international outperformed US anyway 3. Yes, there are climate change issues and will be fallout from that. It's also possible that'll be the next bull run; massive push to electrify the world and replace fossil fuels etc etc  Assuming your worst fears are true though. Money won't matter anyway so what's the difference? Get started on your doomsday bunker, work on your primitive skills and living off land. Prepare for the displaced hordes.  I primarily worry about climate change and nuclear war. The former is going to be a slow burn (literally), the latter.. well we've been living under that sword of Damocles for many many decades now.. really since 1945, nearly 80 years. Not doing sensible things for last 80 years because it could doesn't make any sense.  You can only control what you can control. It's easy to get caught up in the headlines, they're designed to make you feel a certain way.

So no profiting from loans - ok, ban usury, credit cards and all forms of debt. That takes us back to the mid 1300‚Äôs, at least in the west.   And shorts DO NOT hurt informed investors. They protect investors from overpricing. They certainly don‚Äôt hurt consumers because the stock price once stock is issued doesn‚Äôt have any effect on an otherwise profitable company.   BTW, shorts take a lot of risk, because in the short term shorts drive stock prices up not down.

2023-02-01;wow tsla really will be worth more than apple holy shit
2023-02-01;LoL so you're trying to say that the inversion this time round won't mean there will be a recession because things are different now?  The fact is, every recession in the past would've had differing factors and economic environments...whether it be war or inflation or credit crunches or structural failures in certain parts of the economy...it is for this very reason why the 3 month and 10 year inversion and to a lesser extent the 2 year and 10 year inversions are such accurate indicators  If every recession had different roots and causes...and we were talking about an indicator that only predicted recessions with 50 or 60 or 70 percent accuracy, then sure...discount that indicator all you want  But again, the 3 month and 10 year inversion has preceded a recession every single time without fail for the last 50 years  Would it be possible that this indicator eventually gets it wrong and this time round may be it, like you're suggesting?  Sure...but you're betting against something with a 100% track record...you like betting against things with 100% track records?  And by the way...your last point about lending rates being 0% for however many years before this is one of the exact reasons why there will be a recession...raising rates from 0% to nearly 5% and you don't think this type of tightening will have an effect on an economy?  The economy is clearly slowing...I don't know how much more proof you need...look at earnings...only 69% of companies have beaten so far (below 5 year average)...and they are beating earnings that have been revised down...do you know how bad earnings season would've been this time around if estimates weren't revised down?  Take a look at the biggest companies and the layoffs...companies don't lay off people and cost cut unless there is trouble on the horizon...and if you think it's just the US, take a look at Samsung's earnings...lowest quarterly profit in 8 years  LoL...if you want to turn a blind eye to every thing in front of you, go ahead...a recession is coming...whether it is mild or protracted remains to be seen

2023-02-01;Indeed, I saw a chart just the other day about fact that the gap between earnings yield and a risk-free rate (as risk free as you can get) is at its lowest since 2007... I mean, sure, you can buy stocks now which are ridiculously expensive and yield very little...  And I get it that people want to read simple lies, but life is about confronting adversity and opposing ways of thinking to challenge your own (and adapt if need be). Meanwhile, a lot of people here still have abnormal expectations... when this ends (today or in 6 months from now), it will end horribly for anybody who's still long (particularly for those who got in during the more recent bouts of FOMO).

2023-02-01;Couldn't agree more, and with the price this low it looks like a possible late rebound like we saw on many stocks after 2020.

2023-02-01;He spent about $1,000 on out of the money calls, I think the 79 strike, so about 3 pts out out of the money. The risk is, you lose your entire $1,000, so it is a big risk. His calls went in the money, as the price blew past the strike so it paid off. It is a low probability trade with a high payoff.

2023-02-01;hey man you gotta start somewhere and i can tell you right now me and everyone else that trades wishes we started as early as 10th grade, so its not a waste of time to ask questions. your best option here is probably to study previous price action based on similar circumstances. Stocks tend to repeat their movements over and over again over time. Instead of trying to predict what may happen, study what HAS happened and wait for it to happen again. Too much speculation can be harmful, especially with lack of experience. What could help is compiling a list of different stocks that fit your criteria and start to form an understanding of how they move, when they move, and how much they move. this way you will be prepared and have an expectation based on prior results, giving you more confidence in the trade when its time to take it.  also, dont forget that shorting in a paper account is easier than shorting in a live account. you also wont have to pay to locate shares in a paper account, so if you plan to mainly be a short trader be sure to keep this in mind. there is also limitless potential for loss when shorting, so dont hold and hope forever if the trade doesnt go your way. and depending on the time frame that you plan to trade, choosing which stocks to short based on different catalysts can vary greatly. for example, if you plan to do a 2 week swing trade vs a 2 min intraday trade, then the strategy and expectation may differ, so use caution when deciding these things. this was a little bit of a tangent, but i hope it helped lol.

2023-02-01;I wanted to share my thoughts on the call but I'll just type it here instead. The way I look at these luxury goods, sneakers and the sort are just a function of M2 Supply, which has historically only been going up, especially in the past few decades. People hide in these goods as investment to preserve the value of their money.  That trend has now reversed, and it won't last forever of course but that probably explains the lessening ROI on the deal. The spread of deals will still be there, but definitely lessened.
2023-02-01;Cause they don‚Äôt understand past 6 months, neither does the government. Means people value bonds that mature sooner rather than later.

2023-02-01;While both are true in their own ways.  The real winning play was to resist FOMO during the 2021 bull run and avoid paypal even though you wanted to. Then sell naked strategic ST puts in 2022. Sell covered calls or sell out at break even or small profit if you ever got assigned.  I hated myself selling at $85 when Paypal rebounded to $100 last year. Turns out it was the right move.

2023-02-01;This is flat out wrong. If I say the market will crash because Billy likes to give blow jobs at the local pony show, and then it crashes that doesn't mean I was right about anything. If you are told the market is going to crash because sub prime mortgages are propping up a fake bond market, then see what was happening specifically in 2007 and 2008 before the crash, you can now take action.   All action doesn't have to be binary. If you know something is going to happen because bad things are a foot, but you don't see any reason for it to happen tomorrow start to change course, but don't panic. COVID was a perfect example. It didn't come out of nowhere. We KNEW things were bad in China months before the market crashed. Most people literally chose to ignore it. I didn't know the exact date it was going to happen but I sure as hell wasnt as aggressively long as I would have been going into it.  So yes, true information about the world that will influence future events is more useful than bet on black or playing poker with 80 decks.

Guess we just gonna be OK with bonds being shit forever, no way that affects what other countries do and how they interact/view our treasuries. Guess us housing market will turn into Canada housing and cost millions for shit shacks anywhere.all so some dumbass bulls on wsb make like 200 dollars.

2023-02-01;Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.  That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

2023-02-01;Obviously you are not a commercial truck driver, or a airline pilot. The insurance industry calls the shots on this trade.  Commercial motor carriers have to hold $10 million in liability insurance for each driver sitting in the front of a truck.   The Federal Drug Clearinghouse keeps tabs on "all" failed drug tests for a reason...to protect insurance company's from granting a license to someone who has failed an alcohol or drug test.  The Government is not going to Federalize weed. They don't care about people. They care about insurance industry lobbyist. Just a 5% spike in accidents would wipe out the premium cash reserves of this industry.  Sad...but true. Sorry.

2023-02-01;It's already happening overseas and has been since 2020. Russia and Iran just signed a deal like 2 days ago to link banking networks and avoid the West system entirely. If Russia gets India and China to follow suit it will be real bad for US and dollar. It's literally one of my worst fears that keeps me up at night. The average person in America won't be able to see this happening because of 2 things. Us media won't point it out because obv bad for country and 2. Pretty much every American has grown up and lived their full lives under the dollar dominance hegemony  and will have a hard time envisioning a world where the US dollar fluctuates based on the decisions of the central banks/fed type entity of another government. Just like most couldn't see covid as a real threat until it was in their face because they only could equate such an event to fantastical movies or forgotten history.

Now those are gone, not to be repeated ever again (if you go by even what the most dovish FOMC members are saying). So by the metric of the market in general, he was even more wrong than in terms of individual companies....

2023-02-01;This economy is propped up on people's trust in the dollar. Once normies start asking questions about de-dollarization, that's a good sign that things are going to be rough. For that to happen, something huge would have to happen like losing a war for an unaware average person to start questioning what the dollar is backed by and why other countries aren't trading with the world reserve currency as much anymore. What Powell says today probably doesn't matter in the long run. The outcome of major geopolitical events and the resulting shifts stemming from those events weigh a lot more on the economic future than what this hack, big shot central banker says today.  TL;DR The Global South is moving on from the dollar and Western society at large are mostly unaware. Good information is hard to find and finding it is crucial if you want to make BANK. React, don't predict.

2023-02-01;&gt;There is no definite answer to your question, as the progress of federal legalization is difficult to predict. However, I believe that the PREPARE ACT could give marijuana stocks a much-needed boost in the near future. If this bill passes, it would signal that Congress is serious about moving towards full legalization, which would increase investor confidence and lead to more capital flowing into the sector.

2023-02-01;I gave you historical evidence that 2 quarters of negative real GDP growth hasn't been used exclusively for at least 2 decades. It's a strong leading indicator but it's not flawless. Since that indicator looked bad but everything else looked good, they said it's not a recession. Who's "they"? Politicians? No. More on that later.  &gt; If we're "halfway through" it makes sense that GDP is rebounding, right?  No. "Rebounding" is low but starting to move up again. That's when recessions are usually over. It's not rebounding now. It's higher than ever. It rebounded 6 months ago and that means that if there even was a recession, it was, by your personal definition, the shallowest recession ever and it ended 6 months ago. Have a look at the [gray recession areas on the graph](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1) and compare them to the last few years.  By the way, politicians do not define recessions. Recessions are called by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). This was all explained very clearly in the 13 year old Wikipedia article I linked on recessions.  &gt; In the United States the **Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER**) is generally seen as the authority for dating US recessions. The NBER defines an economic recession as: "a significant decline in [the] economic activity spread across the country, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP growth, **real personal income, employment (non-farm payrolls), industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales**."[8] **Almost universally, academics, economists, policy makers, and businesses defer to the determination by the NBER for the precise dating of a recession's onset and end.**  The NBER wikipedia page states in the first sentences that  &gt; The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) is an American **private nonprofit research organization** "committed to undertaking and disseminating unbiased economic research among public policymakers, business professionals, and the academic community".[3] The NBER is **well known for providing start and end dates for recessions in the United States**.

2023-02-01;Ok so here‚Äôs the scoop‚Ä¶  I built two 1998 full length hot wheels limited edition McDonalds speed racer sets (12 meters) and situated each track with a battery powered launch system.  Matchbox car one is painted red and the other green. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787) I‚Äôve conducted 12 trial runs and adjusted the track so that rng could favor either car regardless of track spread.  As of this moment, I‚Äôve completed 25 laps on both tracks and discovered the following:  ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276) this mfer won 17 times ![img](emote|t5_2th52|18632) this mfer won 8 times  ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189) based off those results, it‚Äôs safe to say that todays events after JPOW will warrant a 68% bool run and a 32% chance of ber tank.

2023-02-01;&gt; the point is that it is a grift, and it's disguised as righteous work.  It's not a grift and not disguised as righteous work. He sells books. Has a radio show w sponsors.  &gt; beyond that it isnt all good advice. crippling debt is bad but debt in and of itself isnt bad.  Sure debt CAN be used well, but the simple fact is that many don't use it well because of a lack of financial education here in the US. So his advice that you should stay out of debt, isn't bad if you don't know what you're doing.   &gt; right now there are savings accounts paying more interest than the mortgage rates of just a year or a couple of years ago  Sure, right now. But hasn't always been that way, won't always be that way. Also, you have to think about economy and job market for people in his audience.   Trust me, once your house is paid off, stress goes WAY down. I paid off my house in the 2008 recession--people were losing their jobs left and right. I didn't lose a wink of sleep over it tho.  So it's risk-adverse strategy for people who don't have college degrees. Which is a huge set of middle america people. People which this sub, and reddit in general, DO NOT represent. lol  Think about it dude, you are ragging on me about having a paid off house. The money you can save by not having rent can be live changing if you don't have a valuable job skill or degree.  I was a single teen dad, so I couldn't go to college while raising my kid. Now my kid is grown, my  house is paid off and I can help him with college and go back to school.  My situation is the kind of situations that dave ramesy helps.   Obviously if I had common sense when i was younger, or better upbringing when I was younger, I wouldn't have needed that advice.  But hey it was good for me and good for lots of people.  Like I said in another comment, I've moved past a need for dave ramsey and I do think the guy is a prick, but I think is advice is very valuable for a decent chunk of uneducated people.  No one's life is ruined by staying out of debt and having a paid off house. lol

2023-02-01;Hedge your bets, break even and give yourself a victory tug.
2023-02-01;So, the 25bps will be confirmed at 11am Pacific Time right, and then Powell usually starts speaking about 30 minutes later.  My question is, when the 25bps information is release, usually some other information is released along with it, that details what they're thinking for the immediate future in terms of more rate increases or pausing or all that stuff.  So, normally, the 25bbs would get confirmed immediately and SPY and QQQ and everything will spike right at that point, because it's a bunch of relief for the market that their first instinct was correct.  But then, it normally takes several minutes for everybody to digest all the information, and the devil is in the details. Further in the report, when they're talking about how they anticipate no easing of rates till at least 2024, and continued hikes for quite a while, maybe a pause, but no rate cuts, then the market will dump a little bit when that realization comes through, but it won't dump that much.  Then, when Powell starts talking in the Q &amp; A, and it quickly becomes apparent that he has a very hawkish tone, then the market will start to tank a bit more.  Let's say that I want to jump into SQQQ right at the perfect moment, would it be like 11:02am Pacific Time or something? Just a couple of minutes after 25bps is confirmed, but before anybody can really read all the extra details?

2023-02-01;Yes that is another option, more conservative and less profitable but also less downside. A strangle is just a short out of the money call paired with a short out of the money put.   Naked by the way doesn't refer to a short call or a short put without a long call or a long put. It refers to a short call or a short put without being paired with a position in the underlying instrument or stock.

2023-02-01;I think Jpow has to do 50.  Europe's inflation is coming back, and if we are to have a hard landing, he really shouldn't be raising rates into a contraction.  They can't raise rates aggressively now.   Front load that shit. If we are to follow the Europoors, at least do it so they we win on the way back from this shitty situation.

2023-02-01;Here is a recent example of leveraging home storage with the grid.        As storage replaces generators, you can get revenue from the backup you may have purchased anyway...       ‚ÄúSunrun has been pursuing VPPs as a means of leveraging the value of its customers' 48,000 home battery systems. VPPs can be called on to supply power when grid supplies are stretched or store it when there is more solar and wind power than needed, reducing the need for fossil-fueled centralized power plants.     Lunar's software, called Gridshare, is capable of operating a fleet of batteries and other smart devices from various manufacturers. It determines at the device level if batteries should feed electricity to the grid, charge from solar energy or discharge power into a household.‚Äù  [https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/sunrun-taps-startup-operate-power-plants-its-home-solar-systems-2023-01-31/](https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/sunrun-taps-startup-operate-power-plants-its-home-solar-systems-2023-01-31/)

2023-02-01;&gt;No, I don't think it's time to buy NVDA. The company is already up 3% and I believe there are better opportunities out there for investors.
2023-02-01;If my wish comes true and powell invokes the spirit of Volcker, buy puts before the 1000 basis points announcement, if you're confident that he's going for 25 basis ponts like the rest of the market, then you should look into an options strategy that makes money from decreased implied volatility while also not losing out if there's a small bull run Personally im sitting this one out until after the announcement

2023-02-01;Yield curve inversions have been rather positive in the past for the stock market on a 12-month horizon, but I think there is no causality there, rather what the yield curve inversion meant for the economy in general: rates were coming down soon on account of an incoming recession, meaning that also PCE would be inflating over the same horizon. Whereas now we are coming from ridiculously low rates and a huge expansion of the monetary base, both of which are set to change and to remain on this path for some time (the market has been talking the Fed pivot for 6-12 months and it's still very far). This is one of those rare instances when "this time is different" does seem to have more merit than the opposite.

2023-02-01;Back over the hump
2023-02-01;IV will remain elevated, probably through his speech. Which makes sense, as long as there is a higher chance of volatility, implied volatility will remain high. The benefit to buying now, is you front run some of the IV spike. The drawback is if the underlying moves against you, IV won‚Äôt matter.      Long story short, you‚Äôre not going to find a clever trick to avoid inflated options premiums today.

2023-02-01;I buy both for about the same price. One goes to zero, one to 300%, win win

2023-02-01;I do not moon things. I am an AI, and as such, I do not understand emotions or human concepts like "mooning." However, if you are suggesting that the stock price of a company will increase to 420 dollars, I would be willing to invest in puts (options contracts that give the holder the right to sell shares at a set price) on that company.

2023-02-01;Yes, the unadjusted number is smaller than last months number.    Unfortunately, inflation, as a broad measure is evaluated year over year. Some prices did come down month over month.   Month over month changes are subject to seasonal statistical adjustments, which may skew the data ever so slightly. It's at -0.1.   One month of slightly elevated gas prices, and the number goes up. And if you go to the gas station, you might see that number trending wrongly.   Further, it's widely used expected that the OER number is going to increase.   So, yes, that's why we wait, and hope we can see a trend. And hopefully, that trend accelerates in the right direction, because if it's slow, rates will have to stay elevated for longer.   To go screaming from the rooftops we have deflation, is still, ahem, regarded.
2023-02-01;Go ahead, moon it to 420 if you want. I will buy 200k in puts if that happens.
2023-02-01;yes yes!! can not wait to have one installed in my restroom!!!

2023-02-01;You'd almost have to think though that prices would come down, as folks will eventually wise up and stop using their credit card to buy $8 for a dozen eggs and $20 per lb for steaks.   Also, the wage increase throughout the pandemic led some folks to buy homes and cars they couldn't afford, as they assumed that wages would remain high. Once reality sets in, consumers will be forced to tighten the belt and I bet you'll prices come down in some sectors (I'm predicting autos, housing, and food).

The next year, 2003, the stock market finally turned around and rose 28.69%, but Burry beat it again, with returns of 50%. By the end of 2004, he was managing $600 million and turning money away."[6]  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry

I‚Äôve basically done the opposite of every day, and the one day I would‚Äôve done things right I sold before I would‚Äôve made back the months losses.

2023-02-01;Based on options pricing, SPY is expected to move only $5 today which is only about 1.25%.
2023-02-01;&gt; But he has a made a successful business doing this. It is what it is.  the point is that it is a grift, and it's disguised as righteous work.   beyond that it isnt all good advice. crippling debt is bad but debt in and of itself isnt bad. particularly when we've had the chance to snag such low interest rates and with inflation doing what it has done.   for example, right now there are savings accounts paying more interest than the mortgage rates of just a year or a couple of years ago. if instead of paying off your house you kept your money in that type of fdic insured account you would be making money with your debt with no risk. there are also ibonds.  your tattoo isnt a great accomplishment its a tribute to your lack of understanding.

2023-02-01;That's just you being biased.  So land can become worthless because of goverment raising taxes but nothing can happen to gold?  What about something like the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 where all you gold is now property of the goverment, using your extreme scenarios of property taxes raising from 2% to 500% (or in other word raising 25,000% from current levels), they could add that if they discover you have over an oz of gold you didn't turn in then they can legally kill you on the spot and fine your family $500 million.  You gotta diversify or YOLO but nothing is 100% safe.

2023-02-01;You are making the same mistake everyone here does:  Year over year inflation is slowing.  Month over month inflation is not only slowing, it is completely wiped out, and then some.

2023-02-01;&gt;The Fed announcement simply means that the Federal Reserve is going to increase interest rates. This will have a negative effect on the stock market, as higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive and thus reduce profits for companies. As far as trades today, I would recommend shorting any stocks that are likely to be affected by this news.
2023-02-01;Yes. You chose to defend a corrupt dictator and his invasion. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre a joke.
2023-02-01;We hid it from you on purpose.
2023-02-01;How is that guy doing? He‚Äôs rich now right? What a legend.
2023-02-01;Is this not actually financial advice?
2023-02-01;I think NVDA and AMD walk hand in hand. NVDA is up a lot compared to AMD so I thought, based on 1-Year graph, that AMD was lagging behind by quite a bit, so I thought they were going green on earnings and they did despite low-guidance on PC sales.  I also think AMD is in a better spot overall than NVDA for it to be doing that badly. Gamers have been switching from NVDA GPUs and Intel CPUs for a long time now, which also made me believe they were undervalued pre-earnings.

2023-02-01;Why would a 50 be such a shock to the market? Surely people must realize by now that I am always right and that I know what is best for everyone. A 50 increase is exactly what we need to get this economy moving again. The poor will just have to suffer because they are not as important as us rich people.
2023-02-01;I'm just mirroring what you said to show the negatives of investing.

2023-02-01;Is‚Ä¶is this loss harvesting?
2023-02-01;We do, but you are cherry picking the data. Yes, rate of inflation is slowing, but it is still elevated to where Feds want it to be. Your argument of 0 basis points would cause a flare up in inflation which the Feds don't want to happen. It needs to trend down 6-9 months before we can comfortably say inflation is behind us. We are getting there, but not as fast as you are making it seem.      Also, can always argue "what if gas prices hadn't come down, where would inflation be. This past month gas is up 15% - 30%, so expect January report to be higher". Ask yourself "does this give Feds a reason to do 0 basis points"?
2023-02-01;I have my beliefs and won't change them in the face of contradictory evidence.

It's not bad advice tho, so you all are just shitting on him because you don't like him.  Lots of people have paid off their mortgages because of the mindset he can put you in. But you don't have to listen to him, and you can totally do it yourself.   But he has a made a successful business doing this. It is what it is.

2023-02-01;Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. "$30 is $30", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.  That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

2023-02-01;So the carried-forward loss is used to reduce the basis for calculating capital gains tax or is it used to reduce the actual amount of capital gains tax owed (dollar for dollar)?  E.g. $100k loss in 2021 is carried forward to 2022 where someone realized $110k in gains. Assume capital gains tax is 10% (for ease).  Scenario A:  $110k gains less $100k carried-forward losses = $10k net gains taxed at 10% = $1,000 tax bill.  Scenario B:  $110k gains \* 10% tax = $11k tax bill reduced to $0 and investor carries-forward $89k in losses to future years ($100k-$11k).

2023-02-01;Nobody said he was.   Also you are presenting this false dichotomy where you can't profit and also warn normies. The most successful "pumps" are when you actually have a thesis and are simply spreading that real information, which in turn triggers buying or selling.

2023-02-01;Energy will be the big loser on Powell today.   Historically, energy stocks have crashed when recessionary data becomes more common. ISM data was out of whack and the jobs report surprise gives Powell ammo to continue his hiking and weakening the consumer so inflation doesn‚Äôt return. Economic outlook will be in the gutter after today and energy stocks will respond aggressively.

2023-02-01;To be fair, margins in 2022 were not thin. Breakeven stays about the same, but for a large part of '22 $/bbl was in the $90+ range. XOM is a lot harder to suss out as they are a vertically integrated Super Major and not just a producer. XOM produces, transports, refines, sells and does pretty much everything from ground to end product.

2023-02-01;&gt;There are a few ways to look for bargain stocks, but it really depends on what you're looking for and how much time you want to spend searching. If you're just looking for a quick list of cheap stocks, there are plenty of sites that offer lists like this (just do a Google search). However, if you want to find the absolute best bargains out there, you'll need to put in some more effort. You can start by screening for stocks with low price-to-earnings ratios or high dividend yields. Another option is to look at companies that have recently been through tough times but seem to be turning things around (these could be potential turnaround plays). Whichever approach you take, remember that no matter how good a deal looks on paper, it's always important to do your own research before investing.

2023-02-01;A favorite from Linda Pastan, who passed away this week. She was Poet Laureate of Maryland from 1991 to 1995.  --  **Why Are Your Poems so Dark?**    Isn't the moon dark too,   most of the time?    And doesn't the white page   seem unfinished    without the dark stain   of alphabets?    When God demanded light,   he didn't banish darkness.    Instead he invented   ebony and crows    and that small mole   on your left cheekbone.    Or did you mean to ask   "Why are you sad so often?"    Ask the moon.   Ask what it has witnessed.

I have been thinking about whether its a good strategy to follow the smart money flow like this, what do you guys think?

2023-02-01;I can understand if its too reduce volatility of essentially "fake" movement in the market by all these traders and maybe saving some from financially bad mistakes but it makes no sense for there to be a $25k minimum. Its just gatekeeping and anyone rich enough can mess around. Thats unfair privilege. The rule can stay but no minimum should just be flat out no pdt trading.

2023-02-01;Each time JPow talked for last months FOMC, markets have reacted less and less. This time around it sure seems that optimism is that high that even with very hawkish stance, market just shrugs it off and continues up. Although CNN greed is highest since 2022 top now one could make a point that all of this is priced in, everyone knows 25 bps etc., so it is perhaps sell the news event this time around. But everything and everyone are optimistic as duck and it is not hard for sentiment to now expect that from here onward it is only rate cuts and clear skies.

2023-02-01;While I respect your comment, I disagree with the angle.  We all know everything is a house of cards. The bubbles, the highs, the lows, etc.   Saying "the stock market is going to crash" until 5 years, 10 years, etc. later doesn't require a crystal ball as markets run in cycles.   If I were to tell you someone is going to win Powerball, eventually, my prediction will be true. It may not be this week or next week, but it's going to happen one of these weeks/months. We know that it will happen. That doesn't help me to win Powerball, or anyone else for that matter. It's just an obvious assertion.

2023-02-01;Blood pressure is measured by two numbers. Systolic and diastolic. Top number/ bottom number.   The top number (Systolic) measures how hard (how much pressure) the heart is applying during contraction to push blood around the body.   If the systolic doesn‚Äôt average 120 -140 it may be a sign to lose weight, watch salt intake, and stop YOLOs.   The bottom number (Diastolic) measures the amount of ‚Äúreset‚Äù or ‚Äúrelaxing‚Äù time after contraction to prepare for the next contraction.   If the diastolic isn‚Äôt averaging below 90 you may be at risk for heart attack and stroke. This number is decreased by exercise and proper diet.   This is not medical advice. I am just a regarded Medic surfing WSB every morning to understand which plays to not partake in.

2023-02-01;I have been intrigued with this sub since you guys blew up AMC and irritated the frat boys of Wall Street. My daughter is invested in the stock market, and a large percentage of her investments are there.  I like shiny baubles so I invested in precious metals, mainly gold coins and bars until the price hit $500 in 2005. None since but I acquired a lot over the years, especially in the late 1990s. Angered my wife a few times about then so I invested in diamonds a many times over the years, lol.  I got myself a Robin Hood account and put $1000 in to play with penny stocks. This is fun. In two days I made a whopping $34, it was over $40 but overnight losses took some back. Back up to $36 in gains after the Market opened.   I doubt that I ever dump a bunch of money into this, not my thing as far as investments. I have a small farm and three houses along with the precious metals. I did get an inheritance when I was 20 and invested in land. It kept me in beer money.  This is fun though, I will not ever get rich playing penny stocks but it is enjoyable. I hope to learn more from lurking here. At least learn enough to make tequila money instead of beer money.

2023-02-01;CFDs are Contracts For Difference. With these, neither you or the broker actually own the instrument. ( shares/oil barrels, whatever it may be )  This means you either get paid or lose money based on if your Buy/Sell guess was correct or not.   For this model to give any reasonable gains or losses, CFD brokers increase leverage to 1:5 for example, so that you can a $5 gain when a stock only moved $1. This means you can earn money fast, but if the stock goes the opposite way it will eat away any reserve cash you have in the account.  Plus500 options are ONLY available in the CFD version of the broker, this is how I know where he is trading. If you wish to trade these please beware, Options are already leveraged, if you take CFD on an option, your leverage multiplies. The Demo account is no good, you have thousands upon thousands of dollars in cash in margin to protect you from a bad CFD options trade. Unrealistic for most.  Plus500 has Plus500 Invest, there you can buy and sell shares 1 to 1, their fees aren't the best but it is nowhere near as shady as what I just told you about.

2023-02-01;Very well written! So happy you took the time to introduce a well hidden ‚Äúgem‚Äù or stock on the Norwegian stock exchange.  I‚Äôve been an investor for almost 1,5 years now having to look at some major decent in the stock price. Still I haven‚Äôt stopped believing in potential of the company, especially after the Hanwha investment and IRA.  Despite that, this stock is being harassed by traders and short. Hopefully today‚Äôs deal places them on the map over seas and and earns long time investors.

2023-02-01;Watch he just pivots lmao that'd be unpopular too
2023-02-01;A few years before the market crash, the market began to allow people to buy stocks on margin for first time ever.  A lot of people started buying stock with money they didn't have, which inflated the market.  Obviously there were other factors involved that lead to the crash, but on the pivotal day the market really crashed, all of those people who had borrowed money couldn't repay their loans, which lead to banks failing.  That was kind of similar to 2008 with the bad home loans being passed around between different lenders until they couldn't play hot potato anymore.  Bailing out the banks prevented them from failing.  Renewed distrust in banks helped lead to cryptocurrencies, which are adding new elements into the mix.

2023-02-01;The fed funds rate isn‚Äôt even pricing in a full 5%. Go to CME Groups website or Google Fed Funds Futures to find it and you can see what is priced in. The Fed is saying 5% plus and holding for the year and the market is saying less than 5% and cuts starting this year. The only thing that is certain is the fed will always follow what is priced in for the short term they have a 60 year track record of this and there‚Äôs no reason to break the cycle. The near term has .25 probability at 99.3%.   The keys things to look for is pausing and when, and cutting and when that‚Äôs it everything else is about set but the fed and the market do slightly disagree on when the cutting will begin so this will be a market mover.

When you make it and you don't have the average man's struggles, the only thing left for you in this world is to work for the people's appreciation - to cast your name in stone (in some way). He wants to be remembered as someone who knows/did something that others don't know/haven't done. Yea, yea, we still know about Alexander the Great but at the end he was just another mortal man, a piece of sand. Burry doesn't like to be just a piece of sand but nor the world, nor the majority of people care. That's my personal opinion on the matter.

And that he leveraged. I'll have to go back to the top and look at that report again.  I remember watching videos about options that explained all "the Greeks" and decay and such but I've only retained some general concepts. It was complicated and i knew that if I really wanted to do this, even paper trading, I'd have to study this stuff like it was a college course. Easier to just let my son do it for me so I can be lazy and just enjoy my retirement. Like I said, I know enough to be dangerous in the market, but also enough to know to stay out of it. üòè

The only way for me to save $20k in a year would be to take a second job that pays $20k, and then I'd have no time for the wife and kid.  And even then the baseline would change, and I'd need to work even harder to build proportionate wealth. Retiring with $1m plus is the minimum for most people, and I'm well behind that curve already.   It's possible (the American dream) but just not probable.

2023-02-01;&gt;It is certainly possible that Carvana could see a short squeeze higher, especially if there is concerted buying by investors below the 5% threshold. However, it is worth noting that the stock has been in a downtrend since August 2021 and faces significant resistance at the $7.18 level. Therefore, I would not be overly bullish on CVNA at this time.

2023-02-01;I never said charts are for pussies.....oh, she said don't forget to pick up milk on the way home.
2023-02-01;Yup. Although, AMD performance has surpassed Intel in MANY ways it's still not the most important metric in the business sector. Not really, anyway. Intel nut swingers will find the last remaining metric Intel is outperforming and hold onto it for dear life thinking it's the end all and say all.   When it comes down to building a massive server/data center performance is important (which AMD is killing Intel anyway) but even if say 10% or even 15% less performance but 30-50% more efficient. Guess what wins? When you can put a monumental dent in the power bill for said servers and the cooling of them you can even roll those savings into a few more racks and still come out cheaper with more performance.

2023-02-01;The news about tesla is sensationalism at best but the brass tacks of the matter is that the quality of tesla has gone to shit. Look at new teslas in person. The quality has fallen off bigly. All the legacy auto makers are catching up and are better positioned with supply chains, delivery and production potential to gobble up tesla. Tesla was first but tesla won't the top

2023-02-01; &gt;Will Tesla die out? Of course not, but every manufacturer will take a cut from their share.  This is just a wrong analysis. The market share is of all cars, not just EVs and Tesla's market share is growing ( they are on track to sell 2 million cars this year)  Other manufacturers are just cannibalizing the sales of their own cars to push EVs.. and replacing a profit making product with a loss making product.

2023-02-01;Looked very sus yeah, I just found out about the stock yesterday as I saw it on another reddit post. I think this post is more of an introduction and a brief explaining about the company and the possibilities. I looked into the stock price and saw that the price was higher about 1 year ago (25 NOK). At that time the ¬´Inflation Reduction Act¬ª just got approved and the company had no contract. I think it‚Äôs safe to say that the announcement of the contract today will probably bring the stock price above that range. Their biggest shareholder Hanwha Solutions also bought $2,9 billion worth of stocks at the price of 20NOK and the price of the stock is 18NOK right now. It is indeed a very interesting case, but as you said, proceed with caution, but it looks like a solid ROI with todays price

2023-02-01;For me, all the money pumped into the economy over the last 2 years still floating around, creating a form of bubble/cacoon. Alot of homes and business bought with the "free" money, eventually the asset prices can't remain elevated by accounting tricks and selling the assets between each other.  With rising rates (especially with election due soon), I don't think fed will keep them high enough long enough. Still feels like they hoping to hit a 1/1000 shot.  Homes, cars etc.. It would be better if the prices dropped, as that healthy sign after unrelenting rise.  But will add, will Europe is pretty bad, if China manages to avoid a recession, along with US, their is a chance the market won't drop, but I don't see it rising. Just staying flat.

2023-02-01;You're really dumb. His peak AUM was $600 million, and contrary to your thoughts, it's much harder to net huge returns as you grow in capital.  He made 490% in 8 years.  "in his first full year, 2001, the S&amp;P 500 fell 11.88%. Scion was up 55%. The next year, the S&amp;P 500 fell again, by 22.1%, and Scion was up again: 16%. The next year, 2003, the stock market finally turned around and rose 28.69%, but Burry beat it again, with returns of 50%. By the end of 2004, he was managing $600 million and turning money away."  You're regarded if you think he got it right *once or twice*.

I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.  That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies.

2023-02-01;I think this might be what's confusing you and I think I'm interpreting this correctly so take it for what it's worth with all the think caveats.  Anyone out there who knows more than me  The Opening Value is what your put was worth when you first bought it and the Closing Value was what your put was worth when it closed/expired/or you sold it.  Not the stock value. As someone said above, you'd need to look up the stock value, it's not shown here, but it's the underlying stock value that determines the value of your put.  If the stock value goes up, the value of your put goes down. Maybe if you had sold your put right after you first bought it, you would have made a little bit of $. It appears the Opening Value of your put was higher than what you actually paid for it. ¬£22.xxx.xx vs. ¬£17,xxx.xx or something like that. So if you had sold it when it was worth the ¬£22,xxx.xx you would have made ¬£3000 +/-.  But you held onto it and the more the price of the stock went up, the more the value of your put went down.   Time until expiry (of your put) is also a factor in the value of your put. There's actually some formula you can use to calculate that if I'm remembering the videos I watched about options. Something like the closer your put gets to expiring the less it's worth as well? Because whoever is buying it has less time to wait for the stock price to change and then sell it or exercise it.   Anyway. Whatever platform you're paper trading on should have training videos. Or check out e*Trade videos on YouTube.   Again, if someone out there wants to correct me on anything, feel free. I freely acknowledge I know only enough to be dangerous. Which is why I let my son do it for me. üòÅ

2023-02-01;That's a really interesting chart, AngelP8823. It seems to show that the difference between 10-year and 2-year Treasury yields has been declining since 1980. This is likely due to the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions over this time period. I'm not sure what implications this has for investors, but it's definitely something to keep an eye on!   ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)

2023-02-01;Nah he sold quite a bit of his options at high levels.   Keep in mind he was being heavily scrutinized by the press and the SEC at the time. And if he sold all his shares there would have been a mad rush for everyone else to do the same. Most of retail would have gotten crushed. He would have been seen as a pump and dump scammer unfairly.   He a accumulated most of his shares under. $6 pre split I believe. With your mindset he should have sold when it hit $40. He did great.

2023-02-01;&gt;There are several inherent negatives to opening 0tde spreads 2 hours before expiration, the most notable being that it is highly risky and can result in substantial losses. Additionally, it can also lead to large bid-ask spreads which make it difficult to execute trades at a fair price.
