This project aimed to predict daily jumps in the price of Bitcoin using Reddit data. The project involved collecting data on the number of submissions and comments related to Bitcoin on Reddit, and performing sentiment analysis on the text data using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The sentiment analysis results were used to create features for a predictive model, which was trained using supervised learning techniques. The model was evaluated on a test set to assess its accuracy in predicting daily jumps in the price of Bitcoin. The results indicated that the model achieved a moderate level of accuracy, suggesting that Reddit data may be useful in predicting Bitcoin price jumps. However, further research is needed to improve the accuracy of the model and to explore other potential sources of data for predicting Bitcoin prices.
