2023-02-28;Neither did he after seeing the price now
2023-02-28;This is how the vast majority of people approach investing in general.  People here probably won't admit it but they all sold "early."    The people who really made out probably forgot they had the crypto, then by the time they remembered they had a huge baked in gain.  A sudden windfall like that can paradoxically make people even more greedy (e.g. able to hold out), than had they sat through a grinding multi-year period of appreciation.

2023-02-27;Love how according to OP a blockchain where every transaction is recorded, is better to evade taxes then just giving someone a dollar bill.
2023-02-27;&gt;Is no such a tax on crypto income there  Thats wrong you pay 7% or 19% depending on the thing or service you've bought. The only way your crypto is free of taxes, is when you've held it for a year and not sold it.
2023-02-27;Oh darn, I guess we'll need to switch to Land Value Taxation instead.
2023-02-27;The difference is in the amount (which if large enough will draw interest from the authorities) not because it's crypto or cash
2023-02-27;Lol wtf

2023-02-27;you used their money to get the bitcoin
2023-02-27;Yeah, if they don‚Äôt report it and the IRS finds out, better get ready for prison.

2023-02-27;What if it‚Äôs a german company that did the job ? Is no such a tax on crypto income there ) bdw , lets say in UK the earnings over 12500 in crypto are taxable. What is lower it‚Äôs not. So you being a LTD or Self-Employed you can be taxed on the money that you get regularly but keep the crypto transactions up to this limit . That is a bit of extra money for any regular person that can earn without paying any taxes legally. I tried but people are not vast using it so i don‚Äôt even get to 10k a year in this ) Everyone loves tax free money :)

2023-02-27;You know that undeclared work works with FIAT too, right?
2023-02-27;The worker/employer would be required the report the income and pay the relevant taxes.
2023-02-27;No, its taxed when you earn it as income, immediately.  Obviously its much easier to conceal this from the IRS but that's just classic tax evasion.  Which, no argument from me, crypto is great for.

2023-02-27;I get that the SEC is probably not the way to regulate crypto, but the meme was dumb.  A world without the SEC is a worse place unless something very similar takes its place.    From what you said, it sounds like you see how big money from corporations and individuals is preventing the SEC from operating honestly and cleanly.  That is a problem; a fully functioning and transparent SEC with our best interests in mind is what we need - not NO SEC or similar body.
2023-02-27;Regulation can be done by a number of different authorities, in a centralized or decentralized way. The SEC is centralized and most of its members are trying to screw in a cryptocurrency screw with a hammer like a moron. Only one member of its commissioner board actually advocates for them to think twice before forcing their will too broadly, and I commend her.  Regulations have their place, but the SEC is rapidly trying to overstep its authority in these manners. Furthermore, if we did not have the SEC, yes that would be bad for transparency if no one could immediately fill the role of enforcing that, but rating companies could require transparency in order to get the ratings that investors in securities would trust. That would be the decentralized version of regulating securities.  Fraudulent reporting is committed all the time by fiat banks. And yet the SEC does not go after them. Your belief in the fallacy that government is the only thing protecting us from fraud and that it does a good job of that is not, in my studied opinion, correct.
2023-02-27;Yeah life would be so much better without the sec.  Zero clarity or regulation or reporting from all the businesses that make up basically everyone's retirement funds.  Awesome times getting scammed and defrauded all the time. The fun would never end.  /S

2023-02-25;You have the power to become a literal millionaire and never having to worry about money again.  There won't be many other opportunities in your life to do it so you have to get stuck in now and really change your life.
2023-02-25;Ok thank you. Will try.
2023-02-25;Number 1 rule is protect your capital.
2023-02-25;Most people start out by paper trading with fake money on sites like trading view, there are endless books on how to perform TA, there are endless videos as well. Getting into a discord trading group is probably one of the quickest ways as you can ask others how and why their charts look the way they do.   Then spend an hour or so each day going through your charts and making sure your positions are correct and minimise the risk to your capital.   You can decide to be a scalper, day trader or swing trader. Scalping is lots of high volume trading, day traders typically only make a small number of trades per or even no trades if waiting for the movement to play out, and swing traders do perhaps only one or two trades per month. Or you can do any combination of the above.   Once you understand how to properly enter and exit positions with little/no loss of your capital and are getting to the point where 80+ percent of your trades are profitable you can then look to amplify those gains by trading on margin. Personally I never go more than 10x but some scalpers will actively use 100x margin for most of their trades.
2023-02-25;How can I get the knowledge that you have?
2023-02-25;All traders with a degree of experience are seeing the same chart data, and so place our orders accordingly. That's how herd psychology moves price action. The volume of the orderbook is what defines the speed of those movements. There are currently way, way more shorts than longs, and they're getting wiped out as we speak.
2023-02-25;Well well You seem to be very confident
2023-02-25;100%
2023-02-25;Ok how likely in percent would you say we will go under 17k before the next ATH?
2023-02-25;Say, that's a nice costume
2023-02-25;Future of finance
2023-02-25;It's a matter of when, not if.  The speed at which it transpires is entirely dependant on the capitulation of people who've bought into this bear market rally, many of which have foolishly gone long at $25k. Once they start getting liquidated it initiates a cascade of liquidations as panic selling ensues.

2023-02-25;Anyway if it comes how you say I am very impressed
2023-02-25;Supports, resistance and trends are what give your crypto any value at all, and why your non-shitcoin crypto increases in value.
2023-02-25;Ah I see you like to draw funny lines in the charts
2023-02-25;It's going down, 6% in the last week, and later today it's going to drop down another Fibonacci retracement level to $22.3k, then next week the next level is at $21.8k.   When that level is breached it's going to plummet all the way down to $17.3k. There's a chance it will bounce on that support and not go any lower, but in reality it will probably go further as it tries to establish a double bottom at $15.3k. At that point major capitulation will be occurring by all the people who bought during the bear market rally, causing a new bottom to form somewhere between $10060 - 13.9k. The $10k is by far the strongest support as it spans two complete BTC cycles.   These final selloffs before the bear market flips is what gets most people rekt and panic selling. Experienced traders will short it all the way down, then open a multi-year long and not exit the position until the new ATH in 2025.  &amp;#x200B;  Rinse, buy house, buy car, repeat.
2023-02-25;98,1% of the crypto I hold is btc. Obviously it's not only going up
2023-02-25;A moonboi is someone who buys into crypto assets without performing due diligence and believes price will only go up.   Most of the time they do it with some shitcoin which has only ever had one all time high and then over the course of the next 4 year cycle the price action only goes down, and by the time they realise it they've not only lost pretty much everything they invested, but also missed an entire cycle's 20x gains on non-shitcoins.
2023-02-25;You're a "moonboi"
2023-02-25;I didn't go from $500 to 11 BTC in 3 years by being a shitty trader.   This is why moonbois always end up getting rekt.
2023-02-25;I‚Äôm both just change 70 to 95.
2023-02-25;this is why I put a little bit in. It gives me some incentive to see more info. Then I add a little more and dig deeper. If I really like it, I spread out purchases on down days paying special attention to the crypto tide.

2023-02-25;You have no idea how bad the situation is. Everybody I know including myself have some dollars at home somewhere.

2023-02-25;Sell all crypto then, you ll never get any wins
2023-02-25;Istanbul have crypto ATMs, Istanbul wasn't impacted by the earthquakes.  Bitcoin ATMs are literally a novelty. Not part of the culture, Istanbul also have normal exchange offices where you can sell your crypto for cash on the spot . But that's Istanbul.  Expecting to have crypto ATMs or any crypto facilitation in mersin, Hatay, antakya , gaziantep , orfa and others is honestly laughable.  Furthermore,  a lot of non Turkish residents have a lot of limitations on what they can and can't use , and to which limit .  Again, slow down on the sugars , they do you no good
2023-02-25;Its in USD. They cant do that
2023-02-25;If you are alive?
2023-02-25; https://youtu.be/lxqhmSEt1F8  I can read arabic its turkey and written on the image extracted from turkish side. Turkey have CRYPTO ATM machines since at least 3 years ago.  Wake up its 2023.
2023-02-25;Tens of thousands die, and many more lose their homes and livelihoods.  Crytobros: "How can this benefit me?"
2023-02-25;Indian stock market is a booming market where literally no one loses money on the long term , its not a privilege accessible to the rest of the world. Second of all, if you haven't been to Turkey or not aware of the Turkish situation,  might be wise to slow down on the opinions that will make you look less smart , a lot of Turkish citizens and non Turkish residents keep cash on hand at home in usd aside of what's in the bank, they convert as per their weekly need. I'm a Syrian with a family living In Turkey,  inflation hit super hard in the last 2-3 years , especially skyrocketing rents (more than double) and necessities.  Conclusion: if you don't know,  your conclusion don't really mean much
2023-02-25;In a digital world , bot sure what kinda idiots would see this pic and state the only available solution is crypto. FYI, crypto isn't very liquid in Turkey and other parts of the world , banks do exist you know, they did for hundreds of years and their digital services and account accessibility have been there long before crypto.  1- no proof the family in question is Turkish,  Syrian refugees and residents heavily populate the affected areas. 2- whoever kept that kinda money at home wanted to stay liquid with cash straight in hand for a reason of their own, keeping it in USD to preserve the value of it.  Slow down on the overly processed food and simple sugars , they seem to have affected your brain

2023-02-25;Same approach to backing up your computer.   2 copies at home on different machines, then a 3rd off-site copy of your seed elsewhere. You could leave it with family if they live somewhere else, and tell them to let you know immediately if they are robbed so you can move all your funds to a different machine.  You could also zip it up in an encrypted file with a password and then upload it to the cloud, but that's less secure.   If you've got a 12 word seed phrase then it's not difficult to memorise it either.

2023-02-24;you are very mistaken, i used to live in turkey as a tourist and i paid in foreign currencies more than turkish lira, there are businesses in turkey that accept GOLD.  lira went really down.
2023-02-24;The fuck kinda people you hangout with man
2023-02-24;Idk how the intermediate portion gets handled, but as far as the sender and receiver are concerned, the money is debited from the first and credited in the second, immediately available to be used.
2023-02-24;idk, I just know is not the same, with most banks when you do a payment the money is not credited instantly in the store account, the transaction is actually pending, although it shows as credited. Banks then process the transactions in batch, commonly at night.

2023-02-24;OR .. He can be a rich US tourist
2023-02-24;No man. Context on the pic might be fake . Every country is on inflation infact all third world countries are 20% down to usd . My nationality is Indian . Over there inr is 20% down . If somebody is concerned about 20% . They put it on index stock which on minimum returns 20% . In that way they can have liquidity too. Nobody goes to. infact. I looked up on Turkishindex BI10 . Its 100% Apy per year.  .. USD is a reserve currency too . So looking up LiraUsd is not the best way to analyse.   Conclusion: i still believe context on the picture might be wrong
2023-02-24;Put a link to your comment so that we can go and upvote it (to cancel the downvotes)
2023-02-24;All the third world countries is like 20% down to usd . Lira is just the same. If that person had a concern about 20% and needed liquidity, he would have setup index stocks which always gives 20% up . My bet is that if that person know enough of currency devaluation,he should know about index stocks too .  Conclusion : context of the picture might be fake
2023-02-24;Looks like a turd to me
2023-02-24;Go look up the LiraUSD chart and you'll see why.

2023-02-22;What if you thereby gave him a lambo in the future
2023-02-22;[https://cash.app/help/us/en-us/3056-sent-payments-international](https://cash.app/help/us/en-us/3056-sent-payments-international)  Only US and UK.  This has little to do with being backwards. It's market control and regulation. Digital Payment is a huge market with great profits. The EU has no interest in gifting this profit margin and infrastructure  control to the US.  Regulations make operating non-EU services unprofitable in mainland europe. The US protects their markets like this all the time...  This is why we have our own solutions that work just fine. And US citizens don't know the products we use in the same way that we have little interest in what US citizens use. We just want to send / receive money.
2023-02-22;So, it's their problem)
2023-02-22;Lol, it was me when I advised a friend to come to crypto and sit on crypocto, but this has not yet ruined his life)

2023-02-22;what did you think? digital payment is highly localized... a good example is the system they use in kenya. there you buy little scratch-tickets from your mobile network provider with codes. you can redeem them for movile traffic volume or send them as payment via sms.  in Europe, most people never even heard the names cashapp, venmo or zelle...
2023-02-22;Editing HTML...

2023-02-22;International transfer is where crypto shines. Especially if you send small amounts. But domestically it's better to use banks.

2023-02-20;Thank you so much for your contribution here.   Don't let the door hit you on the way out.
2023-02-20;CZ looks young compared to how old the dev looks
2023-02-20;But somebody has to know who the dev is.
2023-02-20;This is what happened in previous years, or maybe still happening?... BTC holders are the powerful. Nothing can ever break them.
2023-02-20;True. Everyone who invested in crypto lost money at some point.
2023-02-20;This sounds like a weirdly intimate relationship
2023-02-20;Gotta pay for an education one way or another.
2023-02-20;Thank you for the exit liquidity!

2023-02-20;I trust this guy more than some of my friends. Coz I can leave my gf with him in the same room without worrying. But I do not trust ETH stakeholders who might dump ETH by the end of this year.
2023-02-20;Translation: how they let the poor make their own markets and get rich before I can pump and dump on them
2023-02-20;hahahaha! made my day!

2023-02-19;They build a new YT Channel so that‚Äôs the reason. The old channel is still there but without new content.
2023-02-19;I did! It was a surprise his SBF clip didn‚Äôt have as many views so I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was him.
2023-02-19;Subscribe then. New Videos will come and big big thing too.  A lot of big crypto people want to collaborate with him.. and when i mean BIG i mean very very big and important people.

2023-02-19;There are guides but the short form is 1. Import vault into meta mask 2. Swap moons on pancakeswap or send them to mexc and sell them there.

2023-02-19;Sushiswap has them
2023-02-19;Dont right now, this is a clear post trying to get them exit liquidity after the recent pump.
2023-02-19;I don't agree with this reasoning. Unless Reddit is breaking the law or infringing on your rights, why should anyone be able to use subjective reasoning to justify not paying for a service? Markets can't operate like this. I also don't think that two wrongs ever make a right.  Anyway it's not your responsibility to care about this stuff, but I just like to highlight when I see this kind of thinking going on
2023-02-19;How could they convince you to give up those sweet moons?
2023-02-19;It's about the kind of company reddit is. They let many subs that shouldn't have existed more than a day exist for ages until the news started talking about them then they banned them as if they had planned to all along. Reddit didn't give a shit those people are here spreading the fucked up shit they do until it is discussed at large. The content they allow reflects on them.
2023-02-19;Is this a security? Threat to SEC's existence?
2023-02-19;This kind of mentality feels a bit toxic. How are economic systems supposed to work if every participant is purely hostile and avoidant of paying fair value for any goods?  I guess I just don't get being into crypto which is like a hyper efficient system for ensuring that digital services are paid for and then saying that. At the end of the day I guess folks just care about securing their own bag
2023-02-19;It‚Äôs just a website, and what, $5 a month? If I didn‚Äôt want them to make money, why would I use this site? I‚Äôm happy to pay for it as long as it gives me value.
2023-02-19;Watch the market there are moons daily it‚Äôs easier to make money on solid projects.
2023-02-19;my entire life savings is in this man's hands
2023-02-19;Where do I buy moons
2023-02-19;Because fuck giving reddit money that doesn't benefit you. My ad blockers gives me an ad free experience for free.
2023-02-19;Opinions without support are worthless. If crypto buyers remembered that, they would suffer fewer pump and dumps and rug pulls, and that would be better for the "industry".
2023-02-19;That‚Äôs gotta be the epitome of awkwardness
2023-02-19;This.
2023-02-19;The institution‚Äôs attempt to appeal to who they believe are the 99%. Pump that BTC baby.
2023-02-19;Why not both?
2023-02-18;Seems like a bad idea to have a strange figure head who could mess up ETH, luckily Bitcoin doesn't have this problem.

2023-02-18;He has a couple different videos with over a million views.  What do you consider internet famous?  When someone has billionaires for friends why do you think it has to be Elon or Jeff?  If the video is made by 5 old people, why do you think you are arguing with a 14 year old about it?

2023-02-18;you got it wrong then. the reason i said that cos i didnt want to advertise. and by "not hard to find out" i meant that it's a few clicks and u know where to find him. so it is literally not that hard
2023-02-18;Anyway main fact is, that the devs stand for Honor and transparency in crypto. You can check his YT too, to see his messages behind this funny videos they created. Let me know if you need the link ü´°
2023-02-18;Thanks! I now know he‚Äôs playing a large role in how crypto will go but that‚Äôs not the reason I‚Äôm arguing with OP
2023-02-18;My problem is that the user who created the thread asked who the old man was and instead of being helpful you just responded as if he was supposed to know instead of helping.
2023-02-18;man whats your problem? right now u are here in crypto memes acting like a clown. i dont go in subs that im not interested in and start getting into arguments with a stinky attitude üòÅ
2023-02-18;Why did you cut the video at MILF? I want to know.
2023-02-18;Seems you don‚Äôt get it all.. the dev collaborated with CZ (CEO Binance), Jesse Powell (kraken CEO), Saitama (Aaron CMO) and so on.. he will change crypto and he is just a character behind a bigger team. Btw he collaborated with Jake Fuergeson Emmy Award Winner - Creativ Director . He will create Devs NFT. DYOR

2023-02-17;Dang, the bull market has been tough on Tim &amp; Eric. Maybe we really should've sent them our bones. Nice to see Jan again too.
2023-02-17;nice call buddy
2023-02-17;What kind of fever dream is this üòÇ
2023-02-17;Just a start
2023-02-17;Noice
2023-02-17;Channels expand and contract, but the more they get rejected, the stronger they become, because traders expect the rejection and the shorts end up outbuying the longs.
2023-02-17;Trend lines get broken all the time just FYI
2023-02-17;2022*  2023 is bullish
2023-02-17;But it never cost 19K in 2019?
2023-02-17;Horizontal dashed line will flip the bear market, the diagonal yellow line is the resistance we've been stuck under since August.   There is a huge gap below us all the way back to that purple diagonal support  &amp;#x200B;  https://postimg.cc/S2rL7sqC
2023-02-17;That is true , BTC will go lower , your thinking correctly but AFTER it retraces back than it will plummet
2023-02-17;Still watching BTC getting rejected from the 25250 resistance over and over and over again.
2023-02-17;How you doing üëÄüëÄüëÄ
2023-02-17;When it gets through that resistance and flips it into a support, but as has been the case in previous cycles that doesn't mean it won't eventually come all the way back down again for a double bottom.
2023-02-17;same question as before, where does it end?

2023-02-17;So if they lost 90% of their value then went up 10x, you're breaking even? I guess that's technically a win? Good job bro. Let me know how it goes a year from now lol. I bet they'll go up a lot more once he's in prison.

2023-02-17;Any technology hurts the competitors who don't adopt it.
2023-02-17;I have a Masters in Logistics and Economics.     Connecting a road to a town without roads increases the economic value of that town by 100x as every person in that town is able to work and interact with the broader economy.     The same is said for the internet.  It increases the efficiency and velocity of everything, money, knowlege, everything, and exponetially increase the economic value of it.     I guess the next step will be virtual interactivity, which will further increase the velocity and speed of the economy and thus increase the effiency and value.     The fact that people at such heights of power are this ignorant about such basic economic theory makes sad.
2023-02-17;The only thing they can attack is CeFi.     DeFi was literally made to be impervious to this type of attack.
2023-02-17;ALLOW it. &gt;\_&lt;    Imagine being this clueless.  This is the digitization of money, the more they regulate, the more crypto builds.     Trying to stop crypto at this point is like trying to stop file sharing.     The only thing strictly regulating crypto will accomplish is making it so that the servers and all of the activity takes place in countries outside of the strictly regulated countries.     If they want to regulate it, they have to buy into it, and develop inside of it, there's literally no other way.

2023-02-16;I'd argue that he wasn't really that wrong on this call.  I can think of several ways that the internet has hurt profits, and driven smaller companies out of business.  For one, more access to all competing companies' prices means more competition, means less profit.  I'd also argue that the internet has been a net drain on worker productivity.   IT Costs have certainly skyrocketed.

2023-02-16;Larger projects take much more time. An adult sweater similar to this one would take me at least 10 days. Maybe even longer because the colour work is so complex. And it also depends on whether or not you are familiar with the pattern; if it‚Äôs a new pattern you have to keep checking if you‚Äôre doing things the right way.
2023-02-16;We have one huge resistance above us to break out of the bear market, we have one support below us preventing the drop to 13.9k.  Typically we get a 50% capitulation to create the bottom, half of 25k will do nicely.
2023-02-16;K, I'll play.  What's the bigger count?
2023-02-16;thats not a gap bro, look at the gap between 25k and 28k .. there has not been much transactions over there, it has been a straight drop and also on the way to the top back in Dec '20
2023-02-16; I guess I'm fortunate. Through it all, I have gained.
2023-02-16;Are you doing it full time? Because it took my mom way longer IIRC. Or maybe she just never made stuff for small kids.
2023-02-16;Well it has gotten better since the merge hasn‚Äôt it?
2023-02-16;There's an even bigger gap in volume below us.
2023-02-16;its def going to 28k at some point tho, there's a huge gap in between that is yet to be filled

2023-02-16;BTC momentarily rose above it's major 25211 resistance which the moonboys clearly thought was a breakout, then immediately dumped down $700. $2.6Bn longs were wiped out in a fraction of a second.   I had a long set at 25.5 should we have broken out, and would have stopped out most of my shorts at 26.2  I added to my short when we came back up again at 22500. I use 3x margin with 6 figure orders including the 2x part of the position, my liquidation point would be well up into 30k, but would have stopped out at 25.5.   The fact that we went above the resistance by 50 bucks for almost a full minute and it didn't immediately propel us up higher means there were more shorts than longs, and that anyone with any degree of sense set logs a good few hundred bucks above the breakout point.   Look at the large wallet inflows on whalemap, switch the the hourly on the top left and use the side and bottom bars to expand to the last 24 hours:  [https://app.whalemap.io/btc/large-wallet-inflows](https://app.whalemap.io/btc/large-wallet-inflows)  These are large wallet inflows from exchanges, aka whales taking their BTC off exchanges. This creates sell side pressure which pushes the price of BTC up. Look at the chart and you can see every time there was a big move to the upside  it was immediately preceded by whales taking BTC away.

2023-02-16;Looks like you're still wrong today. What's your liquidation price?  Also, we're just randos on the internet. If you're allowing that to fuel your anger and skew your investment decisions, take a pause from the internet and re-evaluate. We actually don't really care if you make money or not. But if you lose money, all it does is grant us randos 5 minutes of amusement.

2023-02-16;And he was wrong because...? It s clear margins have lowered, emerging countries compete more, foreigner speak more English and can replace americans, and people are whining all day long about how it was better for their parents.  The internet is amazing to me, a Normandy-born citizen of Hong Kong who can fully compete in a globalized world, but I think overall it didnt help the americans. At least far less than it helped the rest of us.
2023-02-16;Charlie Munger in 2000:   &gt; *For society, the Internet is wonderful, but for capitalists, it will be a net negative. It will increase efficiency, but lots of things increase efficiency without increasing profits. It is way more likely to make American businesses less profitable than more profitable. This is perfectly obvious, but very little understood.*

So your only chance to sue him is for shilling Tesla :) Even then YouTube is free for users, you are not paying any compensation to the "adviser". And James is the last person you could successfully sue as he usually refrains from saying that you should go and buy something, he just shares his (lack of) actions and research that justifies them. At least in his FREE videos, I'm not on his Patreon.  So sorry, you can't say that anyone who is talking about investing must be a registered advisor, there is freedom of speech after all. Why Jim Cramer himself can give financial advice on TV (with a disclaimer! [https://www.cnbc.com/mad-money-disclaimer/](https://www.cnbc.com/mad-money-disclaimer/)), but youtubers can't?

2023-02-14;Being tall is a huge physical trait women look for. Your response screams manlet cope. He's not some ridiculous overweight couch potato. He's actually strong as hell too so I wouldn't say he's out of shape more so has different priorities regarding his physical condition. I wouldn't say Brian shaw, the five times worlds strongest man, is out of shape. He just has the body requires to meet his physical goals. Shaq has that jacked dad bod physique which again, some women prefer.   Also, as far as personality goes I'm gonna assume Shaq beats you out on that as well bro. And if he's working a regular job like us then he's working a regular job like us so the regular job argument doesn't really apply here. I don't think you know what women want lol. Looks/money is the entry but you need a personality to sustain anything and it can be a huge redeeming factor if the wealth/appearance isn't up to par.   I ain't saying Shaq is gonna be pulling more than Brad Pitt or Chris Hemsworth but if he was a regular Joe than he has enough positive physical and personality traits to out do the other average Joe's. Mainly because Shaq is far from average.
2023-02-14;being tall doenst make you more atractive dude, he is fat, out of shape, he would be an average guy not in the sense of being taller then other, but a regular guy, with a regular job.  i would seriously doubt he would get as im in a way better shape then shaq is. you know 0 about what your talking and about what women like.
2023-02-14;[removed]
2023-02-14;But he isn't a regular guy. He's 7ft tall and all the other things I described. Stick a man with similar qualities as Shaq on tinder and he'll get double the matches of you and I combined.
2023-02-14;wrong he would just be a regular guy. Thats the meme.
2023-02-14;Put his fame aside and you still have a 7 foot tall, strong, handsome, funny, confident and talented man. I stand by my stance that Shaq could pull even without fame and fortune.
2023-02-14;You say he is Shaq because you know he is famous and Rich, ignore that he is "Shaq" and you will understand it. ;)
2023-02-14;My interpretation was all these young women marrying old unfortunate looking dudes because of their crypto bag. Then in a few years shit crashes and they're stuck with old ass men.  I guess it could be that in a few years it'll blow up and all the young attractive women will be looking for old ball bag looking ass men with crypto money.   Depends on your market predictions I suppose.   Either way idk why Shaq is here.

2023-02-14;If you are in the US, as James is, I suggest you look into the Investment Advisors Act. He is absolutely giving Investment advice (regardless of his NFA disclaimer), his business is centered around such advice (his name is InvestAnswers for goodness sake!), and he is receiving compensation for said advice (YouTube and Patreon revenue). I'm not saying others don't do it as well, but you can't reasonably claim he isn't breaking the law.  Also, I love that you consider yourself in a position to tell people of lower intelligence what they should or shouldn't do. That's funny.  I'm done with this back and forth with you, it clearly won't go anywhere. I wish you the best with your investments and hope you are able to pick up a little empathy and humility at some point along the way. "Wisdom is simply the realization over time of how little you actually know and how much you have yet to learn"

2023-02-14;Anyone can give a financial advice, you don't need any licensing for that. If you take that advice you should know that there are no "consumer protections". It's so simple that any person with "smaller cognitive skillset" should understand it. If you don't, then you shouldn't be investing.

2023-02-14;Easiest way to get rekt.   Once you've been through a couple of cycles, you'll realise that 98% of alts never repeat their first all time high.  Nearly all of the top alts from 2017 were gone by 2021, and now the same will repeat. The alts which will moon in 2025 likely haven't even been launched yet, nearly all of the current alts will be never heard of again.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrencymemes/comments/112cpqq/are\_we\_learning\_yet/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrencymemes/comments/112cpqq/are_we_learning_yet/)  In that link above you can see I highlighed a few days ago exactly where the drop would bounce the first time, where it's rebounding to, and where we're gonna be rejected to initiate the final loss of support.    If you ignored this post 24 days ago and are now are 9% down, now would be a good time to take profit and buy back in at that 40-50% discount I was talking about.

2023-02-14;BTC moves in 10k blips during a bull market. You're absolutely wrong telling people to sell because you think they can make a little bit. They risk losing if they sell. If they sold at 23k when you told them they would have missed the 24k bump. Traders don't do as well as hodlers.

2023-02-14;Maybe so, but you don't get to pick and choose when you are qualified to give financial advice and when you aren't, it doesn't work that way. Consumer protections are put in place because the average person doesn't have the capacity to comprehensively do their own research and know who to listen to, that's why certifications and licenses are in place. Just saying "not financial advice" doesn't counteract the way he presents information that very much appears to come across as "banging on the table financial advice". (MANY other YouTubers are guilty of the same). When you create public content on YouTube, especially content that could financially ruin people if blindly followed, you have a responsibility to produce the content in a way that protects even the most dim witted of viewers. The argument that he is just putting out information and people should never listen to someone on YouTube screams intellectual arrogance and a lack of empathy for those with a smaller cognitive skillset.

Of what i seen in shitcoin those who lose money on it most times is the ones who "belive" in the coin and think it will go from 1 cent to 1000$ and the people who earned 50-90% and think for sure it will go to 1000% next day its gone down instead.     If you deal with shitcoins, sell early, even if its fuking orgasmic seing that shit going up, do not end up bagholding, sell rather to early than to late, okish/decent profit is better than loss.

2023-02-13;That's less than 0.5% for God sake !  When was the last time you needed to send 20000$ instantly in another country anyway ? Unless you are a drug dealer ?

You guys are completely nuts.
2023-02-13;They protect retail investors from the burden of wealth
2023-02-13;The country adopted it as a currency so it's a legal requirement for the citizens to accept bitcoin. Sure BTC use is not widely adopted &amp; when they do receive any crypto it's turned into fiat instantly. You are correct they don't want a market crash to wipe out their $ as it's a volatile asset.  &amp;#x200B;  Now for Wise, to send $20,000 it shows a $97 fee. I'd rather not be charged a percentage on the amount I send and be questioned why I want to send $10,000+ when I can send way more $ for less than a $10 transaction fee. Yes there are risks with crypto, it's a new innovative technology and people don't yet understand all the aspects/risks but what new technology isn't. I think the greatest risk to crypto for a normal user is not a hack, but crypto sent to the wrong address.

There's at least 6+ reliable reputable companies that operate nation wide in the US that do instant transfers for near free, most of which partner with banks to do it without any fee. It's very much a non problem.  OP is just insecure about how much money he lost in crypto so far and needs to cope with memes or something.  Imagine trivial money transfers taking up that much of your head space. Real sad.

2023-02-13;Hee hee.
2023-02-13;How much extra did you put in reserve to account for value fluctuation though? How much time did it take for your transaction to actually clear?
2023-02-13;Stop beating around the bush and just post the link to your shitty crypto scam website already, no need to play games here.
2023-02-13;Tidbit but there was this Netflix series based in Sweden, where a character asks another character if they have any cash on hand. The other character replied, "No, I'm not a drug dealer."

2023-02-13;They should make a name for the type of currency like this that uses encryption to do transfers.
2023-02-13;Wise does it fine, with low fees, and without the risk to lose it all on some hack / rugpull or market crash :  https://wise.com/gb/send-money/send-money-to-el-salvador   People don't use Bitcoin in El Salvador : only white crypto tourists do.
2023-02-13;I got it. You send 10 dollars.
2023-02-13;Bitcoins' death will not be with a bang but with a fizzle.    Yes, some people will still make money along the way. However, value will only carry so long as the purchasers remain within the mainstream.   Beyond the mainstream and as you put it. I to niche markets is not a good long-term prospect. This is not a physical product in the its packaging people are purchasing. It's a financial product. That's loosing it's main consumer base.  Let's not compre apples and organes.
2023-02-13;There will always be institutional investors looking for niche ways to make money.   Again, there is a btc fan base that just keeps buying the coins. Forever hodlers who won‚Äôt sell before it hits 100k or more.   They will eventually dump and repeat every few cycles, but such is the nature of crypto.
2023-02-13;Trade those 10 usd in person for btc and send them to your friend using the LN.
2023-02-13;We have a bank app to every bank.  The spesific app I'm talking about was created in 2015 by one of the biggest banks here. And was made so that we could transfer money with our phones. In 2017 the app was transferred to an independent company, not linked to one spesific bank.  I don't know what you're getting at lol.
2023-02-13;Nope, we have a banking app for every bank
2023-02-13;I live in a very rural area. We just got cell service a few years ago. Part of it is that the US is big, and some of it is very empty. Also, recalcitrant people have the option to continue to use checks, and some do. Me, for small personal stuff, I PayPal, or my husband Venmos for me. So, if you can't afford a cell phone service, or a computer and internet, are you unbaked in your country? Have to use cash? Or is no one that poor?
2023-02-13;i am a male karen or a darrin.
2023-02-13;In us it‚Äôs the same. Same day instant delivery no matter when or where
2023-02-13;this was always the plan
2023-02-13;Describe me. How does it work. My 10 dollars in my bank account ending up in friends with zero fees.
2023-02-13;Lightning network
2023-02-13;It's the best option i have.
2023-02-13;Eh, change banks then? Like you basically have to go out of your way to find one that doesn't have instant transfer.
2023-02-13;Y‚Äôall have p2p payment options lol
2023-02-13;&gt; US banks use cryptocurrency concepts to enable instant transactions between unique users.  Databases existed before crypto.
2023-02-13;That's just so weird to me, checks aren't in use anymore over here and haven't been for at least a decade.   Over here we just use same day transfers, I'd just send someone a payment QR code and see the money in my bank account within a minute, even on a Sunday at 10pm. This doesn't involve any additional cost (though some obscure banks do still charge extra for some day transfers)
2023-02-13;I'm talking people trying to send large amounts of money to a place like El Salvador. Citizens don't have banks there, there option is cash pickup sent from family abroad. Bitcoin makes this cheaper to send large amounts for them.
2023-02-13;You can deposit a check by taking a photo of it, sending it to your bank, then use the money to pay whatever. I only see checks for weird things: old pay from an old employer who no longer has a link to my bank account. An advance for a writing project, of $8.23.
2023-02-13;Can I turn the Bitcoin into fiat, so I can use it to pay my bills? No, this exchange does not do that any more. Bitcoin is a store of value. HODL
2023-02-13;I literally used venmo to pay my friend yesterday for superbowl activities. He got it instantly, on a Sunday
2023-02-13;Can anybody explain me how I would send 10 dollars using bitcoins to a friend insantly without a fee?
2023-02-13;Doesn‚Äôt U.S. bank allow Sunday transactions? You don‚Äôt need bitcoin, just learn efficient banking from places other than U.S. such as Korea.
2023-02-13;Dime for your sadness
2023-02-13;Idk what‚Äôs so funny about me choosing from Apple Pay, Zelle, CashApp, Venmo, or PayPal literally any day of the week.  You know, or my bank.
2023-02-13;What are you talking about?
2023-02-13;I agree with your antiquity viewpoint. I would also be aware. Rarity is not a factor here. New techs have been released that far exceeds bit capabilities. This will make most of its users abandon btc alone. Beyond that, institutional investors won't invest in antiques. They will, however, pour money into alts that have utility.

2023-02-13;Their website doesn't even say it's instant. Also it's only euros.
2023-02-13;So it's a 3rd party app not the bank app correct?
2023-02-13;This is the way...
2023-02-13;Sounds like a big you problem lol. You should probably work on actually making your life better and easier instead of posting shitty Bitcoin memes all day
2023-02-13;Completely support, in my country we have online banks in app

2023-02-13;Unfortunately, this is true, now exchangers are becoming easier and simpler, for example, I'm on Crypocto and you don't even need to register there, everything is done so that even the most stupid can press the "buy" button

2023-02-13;Portugal is part of UE. Most banks there support instant and free transfers via SEPA.  So either : - you're a teenager and did not use any bank yet - you are just a lier. - your bank sucks, change it
2023-02-13;Portugal.
2023-02-13;Sepa is 1-3 days, unless your bank offers instant Sepa which mine doesn't.
2023-02-13;International transfer?
2023-02-13;I dont think this is real. It says meme
2023-02-13;[removed]
2023-02-13;Also, wallets break (wear out) all the time. You just take your money out and put it in a new one.
2023-02-13;I dunno, it's annoying af
2023-02-13;Whoops. I thought you're from India. Those were all different protocols for doing bank transfers.  UPI is instant and takes less than 1 second, NEFT and IMPS take between 5 to 30 seconds MTGS can end up taking a few minutes. There not too much reason for using one over the other (there are differences in the amounts you can send, but not too important), except that UPI is the most convenient. Literally just need to open a UPI app like BHIM, GPay, PayTM or PhonePe etc and tap send (using phone number, email id or UPI id of the person)
2023-02-13;Zelle exists which most banks offer and it's free instant transfer
2023-02-13;So in your country people accept Bitcoin as a payment method? Otherwise what's the point
2023-02-13;I have no idea what you mean with all those letters.  I'm my country our app sends money from one bank account to another in a split second. On a Monday, on a Sunday, on a bank holiday. You can also buy bus tickets with this app. And pay for your shopping some places.
2023-02-13;I can easily give my friends money any day of the week through my bank
2023-02-13;If you think any crypto-based system is or will ever be as convenient and as widely adopted as the standard, banking-based solutions already out there, you need to come back down to Earth and connect with reality.  Cryptocurrencies may have other advantages, which can be inferred from the activities where they *have* been adopted over the last few years (e.g.: ransomware, illegal trafficking, etc.). But claiming they add anything worthwhile or useful in the area of (legal) consumer money transfers is simply delusional.
2023-02-13;Good Doge
2023-02-13;You are coping and it is cringe
2023-02-13;I literally sent money between my bank accounts on Sunday and it took barely 5 seconds
2023-02-13;And here I thought waiting 15 seconds is a delay
2023-02-13;Why would it take a day!? Here it takes less than 1 second
2023-02-13;Are you talking about UPI, NEFT, IMPS, MPGS or just wallet transfers like PayTM? üòù
2023-02-13;People don't keep all of their savings in physical wallets
2023-02-13;How can the bank stop you? Here in India you can do bank transfers any time and it will instantly get credited. I have stopped carrying my wallet for almost 7 years now
2023-02-13;He is clearly lying, even in my shity country you can send money at anytime using bank application.
2023-02-13;True
2023-02-13;Maybe you're choosing to use chains and wallets that aren't convenient
2023-02-13;Well, if the CEO of Bitcoin said it‚Ä¶
2023-02-13;Some people believe anything that has to do with distributed computation is crypto  Torrenting has been around since I first laid my hands on a computer a decade ago or more
2023-02-13;Not allowed in the EU.
2023-02-13;Depends on your bank. By the way, unless you have a private wallet, crypto transactions are not credited instantly either.
2023-02-13;In the EU, SEPA lets you transfer instantly any time you want to.
2023-02-13;May I ask :    How old are you and where do you live ?  It does not sound like you ever used any bank in your lifetime.
2023-02-13;&gt; ACH is not a monolithic system  It's distributed indeed, but also centralized (controlled by an institution / few persons) Most IT system are. It's been like this for decades. Still it has nothing to do with a blockchain.  &gt; We have had smart contracts   "Smart contracts" means nothing. Yes we have had stored procedure on SQL DBs since decades too. Still absolutely nothing to do with blockchains.  You seem to discover that distributed system have worked fine since decades and that none of it requires "blockchains"
2023-02-13;And don't you think saying...  &gt; Europe and it's the same.  ...is quite misleading when you're purposely choosing to stay in one of the banks that don't give you an option that's been available for 6 years now?  That'd be like me saying that BTC transfers are not available in my country because my bank's app doesn't have an option to create a wallet.  The options are there for anybody who wants to use them. They're easy to use, they're free, they're convenient and they're secure. They're much simpler to use than crypto, which is why they've been widely adopted already by anyone who cares. In other words, the problem is solved.  Cryptocurrency was never convenient, easy, cheap or secure enough to be a viable alternative for instant transfers, which is why it never took off as one.
2023-02-13;you can't stop the automatic settlement of payments   And the ACH is not a monolithic system.
2023-02-13;Thanks mate, for me it‚Äôs actually nothing special but i was so surprised to see the BTC cake haha, made my day!!!
2023-02-13;The plate presentation is beautiful.
2023-02-13;But it goes.. in the square hole
2023-02-13;Well I don't. During the week it's about 24h delay, during the weekends nothing happens until Monday.
2023-02-13;I'm not claiming these things don't exist, I'm just saying they don't exist in the bank I've been using for years. And it's a big bank in the country I live.   But as I said, I guess you know better when money appears on my account.
2023-02-13;I'm in Europe and we have instant and 24/7 transfer between banks via the app.
2023-02-13;We're not talking about traditional bank transfers, but you already knew that. If you were able to figure out how to use cryptocurrency, you sure as hell know how to use Venmo-like systems, or instant bank transfers.  You're just choosing to ignore those easier, cheaper options, which are widely accessible to everybody already, so you can create a fictional problem and paint crypto currency as the solution for it. Unfortunately for you, the problem doesn't exist anymore.
2023-02-13;Lol okay then I guess you know better than me when money arrives if I transfer from one bank account to another.
2023-02-13;And so do i
2023-02-13;This has absolutely nothing to do with blockchains or crypto currencies. It's just an app on top of a centralized transfert system.
2023-02-13;No it's not.  Instant transfers have been a thing for a long time now, and they arrive the moment you tap "send".  Also, on top of that, most countries have had some kind of platform in place for years now (e.g.: Venmo in the US, Bizum in Spain, UPI in India, etc.) that is seamlessly integrated with the banking system and doesn't even require you knowing or entering bank account numbers. You can send money to any phone number in your contact list and it's in their bank account, instantly, for free.  Unlike crypto, the adoption of these platforms has been outstanding, reaching almost 100% penetration in most of these countries and becoming the de-facto standard, as they are extremely easy to use by anybody.  This meme is simply false.

2023-02-13;Question: Do you have processing delays ?  Some banks put delay between the moment they apply an operation and the moment it's show up in your internet account details.  Doesn't means that it's not transferred.  If you have the same delay when you us a credit card. That only the internet account details that isn't updated.
2023-02-13;Yes, find another bank. All French banks allow this for example.

Some estimations put hbar around 800ktps within 5 years or roughly 70 billion transactions a day or 25 trillion a year.

2023-02-12;Not for at least a week, we're going to move back up to $22.5k first and get rejected a few times before we come back down to this level again and lose the support. Then we'll dump to 17.2k and repeat again at that price level, before the final sell off to true bottom, around 13.9k, which will then initiate the bull market.

2023-02-11;This is why you don‚Äôt have a love lasting relationship
2023-02-11;You're doing it wrong.      You‚Äôre half way there, but you can‚Äôt just set random traps to fulfil orders and expect results from wicks down.  16k, 13k etc are nowhere near liquidity nodes.     Volume profiling will show you where traders are setting their stops and orders, and where there are huge gaps in liquidity.   For example if the price is going down and you can see a billion dollars worth of buy orders at 14k, you‚Äôll want to set your order at 14.1k to be sure of a sale before the buyers below you start eating into that resistance.    Then maybe once you‚Äôve done that you‚Äôll set a stop at 13.9k just in case there are more sellers than buyers who munch up those orders and push the price down further, so you won‚Äôt miss out on a 13.9k buy if the next liquidity level is 12k.

2023-02-11;Maybe we'd be more inclined to listen to you if you weren't being a condescending douchebag calling everyone a moron and telling them they're gonna get rekt.  Nobody will take your advice if you give it like a prick
2023-02-11;That's all very interesting but the thing is I have buy orders set all the way from $16k to $13k. Knowing the powers that be, there is no way in hell they will let me fill those orders. Therefore, butcoin will not drop below $16k.
2023-02-11;I count my chickens in advance to project risk as far ahead as possible. I would be a fruitless trader if I couldn't.    $13.9k was priced in weeks ago. I guarantee that at $17.5k people will still refuse to recognise this as a bear market rally even as we dig through to $15k.   At that point most will be hoping 13.9k is the bottom.  I can't project beyond that yet but if we do lose it then $10060 is a multi-cycle major support, and would be very much in keeping with the final capitulation in previous market cycles dropping 50% rapidly, before regaining it back up again in short order.
2023-02-11;Thanks SEC for protecting me from passive income!!!

2023-02-10;[removed]
2023-02-10;This might make it a little easier for you to see the supports/resistances, I've made them orange dashed lines.  Using volume profiling you can figure out where these are, and then just trade the range between those lines as price action bounces around between them.      The very top purple dashed line is where we needed to get to to break out.  You can see we failed to even make it into that range, to say nothing for breaking out of it.      This lets you see where to place your stops above and below as we break out or fall through each one. As you can see we would now need to plow up through 4 entire resistance/support ranges we just spent a week falling through. It's highly unlikely we will, yet we only have to fall through this one remaining support to drop all the way down to 17.2k.  &amp;#x200B;  https://postimg.cc/yWnqjs2S
2023-02-10;üöÄ  üåù
2023-02-10;Did this amuse you, or was it disturbing?
2023-02-10;Thank you for buying at 0.17
2023-02-10;Volume profiling.   Also, that's not how you set a short, or a long for that matter. You don't just yolo into it.  First thing is to determine where the volume and liquidity range is, which then allows you to see what price level has to be reached in order to trigger the breakout or the sell off.  You set your long above that position, or your short below that position.  In the mean time you can just trade the range bouncing up and down, as we've been doing for the last 22 days. Easy money.     In this case we needed to get above 25500 in order to break out, and I set my stop under the price every time we kept trying to push through so it would catch a nice short back to the support. We failed 5 times to break out to 25.5k, and the key to figuring out that the 5th was the last time is because it was the only attempt which failed to reach a higher price than the previous attempt, ie a lower high. That confirmed it was the correct position to short. Since then we've only kept going lower and as expected we fell through the support.    Right now if you look at that chart above you can see the yellow and white horizontal lines which will create the final shoulder of the head and shoulders pattern we've been in since the 16th Jan.      Given that we just fell through 22350, it's unlikely we'll push through it again on the wrong side of a rally as the support now becomes a resistance and people are selling, not buying in like the rally. The whole head and shoulders is slanted. The bottom of this shoulder is now hitting the top of the previous shoulder resistance, as it's providing us with the support to bounce up again and is the reason we didn't just plummet all the way back to 17k in one swoop.      That support will fail though, and while I'm making the most of the ranging between 21.4k and 22.6k for easy scalping trades, it will eventually lose the support and ride all the way down to 17.2k-17.4k, so I'm always cognisant to place a stop under 21.4k when I'm longing the range back up to 22.6k.

2023-02-10;Die with more crypto!!! Let's do it!
2023-02-10;Yeah ‚Ä¶ we understand your thesis for the short.   But if you see an invalidation of the 22.5k level (based on your chart above), you‚Äôre still not going to flip long? Still going to keep your short bias?
2023-02-10;Manage risk and set a stop. We won't pump harder, all of the money flow vanished three weeks ago, smart money has gone, just dumb money getting rekt with frivolous longs at 24k. And they will keep buying the dip all the way down.  We are going to be bouncing around here up and down between 21450 and 22700 for the next week or so, easy to trade in that range, and then one of those bounces back down will lose the support and we'll be back at 17.6k in short order.      Easy money.

2023-02-10;Ahahahhaahah
2023-02-10;This entire bear market rally has already gotten morons rekt who longed at 24k. Now they will do it again over and over all the way down to 13.9k, and of course they will blame "the bears" and anyone who dares point it out to them.   Usually they'll get it right on their 2nd cycle with diminished gains.   &amp;#x200B;  Hopium is a hell of a drug.
2023-02-10;Of course we are. You forgot to take into account the Young's modulus.
2023-02-10;We've not bottomed yet.
2023-02-10;So you're telling me I should buy **now** because +5% is imminent? Can do!
2023-02-10;You've hodled about minus 8% of your portfolio value over the last week, most of which in the last 36 hours.  Imagine the look on your face at $13.9k..

2023-02-04;Yeah I can go on forever. However, I tend to have a few opinions that would probably align with your way of thinking.  1. Eventhough bitcoin broke through a trillion dollar marketcap not too long ago, it is *still* an experiment. It aligns near-perfect with the austrian school of economics from von Mises. This school of economics is different than the Keynesian model which the USA (central world power since WWII) adopted once they got of the gold standard in the early 70's.   Now, we know that the keynesian model kinda works, but the problem of corruption and misbehavior from incredibly rich/powerful people has continued to exist till this day. Bitcoin is the first protocol that kills corruption, eventhough exchange manipulation is still happening. One could debate wether this manipulation is actually bad, because as far as I know it secures the upwards potential for long term holders.  These exchanges aren't going to manipulate bitcoins price just so that it can go to zero, no, they usually like to acquire as much as possible for as cheap as possible. This does fuck with bitcoins price volatility, but at the same time it secures bitcoins value over time.   I got way off the rails. Excuse me.  Good arguments against bitcoin: 1. We dont know what the impact will be once every single western government decides to make bitcoin highly illegal and publicly stigmatized. Like I said, betting on bitcoin is betting on the possibility that our fellow humans remain rational. Government propaganda could screw with this heavily  2. We dont know what would happen if a MASSIVE "whale" suddenly wakes up (aka wallet that bought bitcoins for pennies) and tries to convert their holdings to FIAT. 3. Before 2020, a handful of individuals could buy all the bitcoin that existed on their own. They could sacrifice their money to destroy bitcoin. 4. If the bitcoin community suddenly goes into the wrong direction (example: larger blocksizes), the experiment could be fucked. 5. There is an issue with differences in value. Bitcoin that has recently been mined is valued higher than bitcoin that went through a billion transactions.

2023-02-04;You no like cheap crypto ? üòâ
2023-02-04;&gt; Transactions are slow   Not with LN. You have to remember that bitcoin is a layer one solution, similarly to how gold has been de foundational ground layer during the industrial revolution.   Thats not to say that people used literal gold for the exchange of good and services. No, governments used paper that was supposedly backed by gold, similarly to how the dutch did this before England took the throne in 1780. This "paper backing" for gold is like LN for bitcoin.  You see, you create one foundational baselayer in the most minimalistic and fault-proof form. this means that we should not immediately go for a larger blocksize when the market is hot. Tech will evolve overtime and the aspect of decentralization has to be cherished at all cost, hence the reason why nodes with low storage capacity are still able to run and secure the blockchain.   (Bitcoin cash was, and still is, a ridiculous abomination. The function "store of value" is truly unique and irreplaceable. Only one asset can have the status as "the best store or value", bitcoin has yet to beat gold but it'll do it one day)  &gt; and price stability sucks as there is more speculation than usage going on.   As long as the flow of new dollars/euros/whatever keeps increasing over long time periods (longer than 4 years) then it doesnt matter that bitcoin is volatile. It just shouldn't drop to the all-time-low of the previous bearmarket, not yet.   Bitcoin is also heavily being used in third world countries since there are about a billion people unbanked. Bitcoin is incredibly attractive for these people.  &gt; It's true it's a pure coin which only serves to store value and perform payments.   If its able to stabilize its price then its pretty much the ultimate form of money.  &gt; You could compare it with gold as it's also quite heavy to move but it's way more volatile.   Quite heavy to move?... a few clicks + a couple minutes, and I can send $500 billion worth of bitcoin to the other side of the universe. FIAT was invented because gold was heavy to move, which kinda brings me back to the thing I states earlier: we might see layer solutions built on top of bitcoin similarly to how fiat was invented to reduce the shortcomings of gold.  &gt; You can't compare it with stocks ( no crypto ) as the value of a stock is created in a totally different way than the value of crypto, crypto's are more like equities equities used for technical needs.   The value of a stock actually makes sense, crypto doesn't. In the end, they're both just tools to gather money for the shareholders.  Its a tool based on human greed. It gathers money from the general public, since they will have the opportunity to gain money through speculation. Meanwhile, the largest holders of a stock/crypto (usually the founders) are now able to extract that money and use it for their business.  Crypto is just a way to do it in a non-regulated and decentralized way. The problem with crypto, is that its real world appliances are hard to understand. They also seem kinda unnecessary at the moment.  Sure, blockchain gaming or privacy protocols have their uses but they're no where as important as the energy industry or the automobile industry  &gt; Sooner or later something happens you don't understand because you never read the developer documentation and only use technical analysis. It's like investing in BP without knowing what their plans and specialities are, you don't do that.   So, how is crypto different from stocks again? Hahah. You get my point, right? No mean to sound like an asshole btw. I know there are definitive differences between the two, but they're just tools to extract money from the public towards highly-productive individuals. (Thats the idea, setting up a crypto is so easy, all you gotta do is sell your ideas and you're in the money, which makes crypto (especially tokens) a perfect tool for scammers unfortunately...)  &gt; So I look at a crypto's function, try to spot what is speculation and what is real and try to imagine future appliances beyond fintech.   I admire your confidence, but lets be real: how accurate are you going to predict the future? Also: the market doesn't seem to be driven by rationality but mostly by emotions. If making predictions through rationalizations/empirical historical evidence wasnt already hard enough, how the hell are you going to incorporate unexpected and events that are usually inevitable?  &gt; For BTC I don't see much future appliances beyond trying to buy low and sell high and hedge fund backing, you get more liquidity when the BTC price drops because of FOMO and the thing kind of started to follow wall street lately. With one difference, wall street doesn't FOMO. Once the FOMO ends BTC ends.   I dont think thats the case. Imagine you're a decendant of the rockefeller family in 1971. How are you going to protect your wealth when the USD had to inevitably switch to a FIAT standard? You buy gold. Its as simple as that.  Now, take a look at the richest and most influential families/groups/governments in the world. What do they all have in common? Well, (based on the marketcycle) they hold a substantial amount of their holdings in gold.  &gt; I'm pretty sure some hedge funds are buying real stocks with money collected from selling BTC they mined.  Just like how some hedge funds are buying BTC with money collected from selling real stocks they promoted.  &gt; But I don't invest in a traditional way, I buy a bit of crypto I see appliances for, and try to create gains by developing an appliance or an NFT project, at least that's the plan.   I do! I'm a neurotic individual. My personality tells me that I should stay the hell away from trading. In fairly conservative when looking at decisions and I like to stay calm.  &gt; Still recovering from chemo brain so currently there's only some modest hodling going on.   Get well soon! Cancer?  &gt; Still a low market, BTC made a jump ... jep that's what that thing does.   It jumped due to shorters being liquidated. So it basically jumped up because too many people thought it would drop. I think the possibility of bitcoin dropping as low as 15k is higher than 60% in this or the next year. Which is also the reason why I own bitcoin as opposed to crypto. I'd rather dip 50% and buy more, because my confidence is completely vanished if I would drop 95% like most cryptos

2023-02-04;Why does he do that with his hands?
2023-02-04;How is any other crypto a better tool than bitcoin if it cant maintain the same price stability, (with the exception of fiat-pegged cryptos)  Price stability is the determining factor of how good a certain money is in its function as a unit of account.  Sure, bitcoin still has a long way to go to reach the same price stability as, lets say, the Euro. But one can guess that, generally speaking, more money put into a certain asset equals more price stability.  Its common knowledge that a microcap is high risk/potential for high reward due to the multiplier effect. A marketcap of 1 million is much easier to multiply 100 times (resulting in a marketcap of 100 million), on contrary, a marketcap of 500 billion is WAY harder to miltiply by 100 times (resulting in a marketcap of 50 trillion)   The problem with bitcoins price stability is that we all collectively have treated bitcoin as a tradable asset. Gold had this exact same problem in 1800-1900's. People run to gold during marketdown turns, causing it to be overvalued, and the same could be said otherwise; people ditch gold during new bullruns for lower marketcap stocks.  Gold and stocks, is incredibly similar to bitcoin and  crypto. It baffles my mind that people dont believe in bitcoin, yet find the confidence to believe in centralized cryptos.  Btw: the word "decentralized" is HEAVILY overstated for literally any crypto.   No other crypto has a single developer that went missing 10 years ago. (Similarly to how the torah, bible and quran are still effective to this day. Im not a believer but recently studied a bit on traditional believes. The reason why they still work is because there prophets arent alive to "corrupt" the story)  Also, no other true crypto has been developed before bitcoin.  If bitcoin goes down, it will take the whole crypto market with it. It carries it on its back, and expecting a flippening is betting on the fact that people are less rational than they should be.

2023-02-03;Well ETH also as same as BTC, or sometimes I'm personally find it's more volatile than BTC. So enter the right time into the trade would be difficult.
2023-02-03;Don't underestimate BTC
2023-02-03;Checking is job for crypto trader
2023-02-03;What about ETH?
2023-02-03;Of course, you won‚Äôt take Lambo at the prize draws, but as a fallback option
2023-02-03;My skills are in the fact that I sit only on crypocto and in case of unprofitable trades I can count on a chance to win in the prize draw
2023-02-03;Looks like a porn movie thumbnail.

2023-02-03;Why is not Jim Cramer in the right pictures?
2023-02-03;Hope 2023 is as good as it started
2023-02-03;Last year was a watershed moment for everyone involved in cryptocurrency. Well, 2023 is only getting started. We're only in the second month. Let us just keep watching and waiting. The market may move sideways.
2023-02-03;It's so beautiful
2023-02-03;Once a friend asked me why I was sitting on Crypocto and trading non-existent money. I don't have a friend anymore

2023-02-03;If it's too long, then it's suspicious
2023-02-03;It's true, once I really stayed too long on crypocto and the boss praised me ... But then he found out that I hardly worked then

2023-02-03;Is it Cramer?
2023-02-03;How glad I am that I started to sit on crypocto when BTC was 16k, so I would also be among these lost souls

2023-02-02;There are never enough crypto assets or the ideal wallet for me.   I continue to acquire more assets because I want to own Lambos. But due to the recent exploitation of BonqDao, I have recently stopped acquiring more ALBT, as the old contract of the token will be replaced by a new one. I'm hoping to resume bagging more ASAP.

2023-02-02;I‚Äôm thinking it makes a big cup and handle pattern. It would be a good buying opportunity and also a bullish sign. We shall see.
2023-02-02;Belgium we are supposed to treat "investment products" with care and kindness. Buy...hodl or pay huge taxes.  Speculation by ordinary folks is discouraged to protect the brussels stock exchange and local companies and it also protects morons from gambling addiction. There are pro's and cons when you apply this to crypto.
2023-02-02;If it looks like a bottom and feels like a bottom it is the bottom üåà Until the chart prints a new bottom ; could be higher, could be lower ( although for me i think its in).
